ingredients:
  - 1 1/2 lb red baby beets, 1 to 2 in in diameter
  - 4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
  - 2 tbsp water
  - Kosher salt
  - Freshly ground black pepper
  - 1 tbsp plus 1 tsp sherry vinegar
  - 1 tbsp fresh orange juice, plus 2 oranges
  - 2 tbsp hazelnuts
  - 1 ripe avocado, cut in 1/4-in-thick slices
  - Flaky sea salt
  - Best-quality olive oil for drizzling
instructions:
  - Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. In a roasting pan, toss the beets with 2 Tbsp of the extra-virgin olive oil and the water and season with kosher salt and pepper. Roast until the beets look caramelized and feel tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, about 25 minutes.
  - When cool enough to handle, slip the skins off the beets and cut into quarters. In a medium bowl, toss the beets with the remaining 2 Tbsp olive oil, the sherry vinegar, and orange juice. Season with kosher salt and pepper and let stand until the beets have absorbed the flavors of the dressing, about 30 minutes.
  - In a small, dry frying pan over medium heat, toast the hazelnuts until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Lay out on a work surface and let cool. With the bottom of a heavy pan, crush the nuts.
  - Section the oranges by cutting off both ends. Set on one end, and use a paring knife to cut away the peel and pith in strips, starting at the top and following the curves to the bottom. Then, holding the orange in one hand, carefully insert the blade of the knife between the flesh and the membrane to cut out the sections without any membrane attached.
  - Arrange the beets on a serving platter with the avocado slices, and sprinkle them with sea salt and pepper. Distribute the orange sections throughout the salad and sprinkle with the crushed toasted hazelnuts. Finish with a drizzle of best-quality olive oil. Serve immediately.
notes:
  - Use baby beets 1-2 inches in diameter for best results.
  - Let beets marinate in dressing for 30 minutes to absorb flavors.
  - Serve immediately after assembling for best texture.

## Why Roast Beets

Roasting is one of the best methods for cooking beets as it concentrates their natural sugars, resulting in sweet, tender beets with deep, complex flavors. The caramelization that occurs during roasting adds another dimension to their earthy taste.

Unlike boiling, which can leach some nutrients and flavor into the water, roasting preserves all the goodness of beets while enhancing their natural qualities.

## Serving Suggestions

Roasted beets are incredibly versatile and can be enjoyed in many ways:

- **Simple Side**: Serve warm as a side dish alongside roasted chicken or grilled steak
- **Salad Addition**: Dice and add to salads with goat cheese, walnuts, and arugula
- **Grain Bowls**: Mix with quinoa, farro, or other grains for a nutritious meal
- **Hummus Enhancer**: Blend some roasted beets into hummus for a beautiful pink dip
- **Sandwich Filling**: Layer slices with other roasted vegetables and goat cheese in sandwiches

## Variations

### Honey Balsamic Roasted Beets
Toss the beets with 1 tablespoon of honey and 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar before roasting.

### Spiced Roasted Beets
Add 1 teaspoon of cumin, 1/2 teaspoon of coriander, and a pinch of cinnamon to the seasoning mix.

### Citrus Roasted Beets
Add the zest and juice of one orange to the beets before roasting for a bright citrusy flavor.
