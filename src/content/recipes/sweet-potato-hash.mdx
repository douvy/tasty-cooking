ingredients:
  - 3 Tbsp virgin coconut oil
  - 1 large sweet potato, skin on, cut into 3/4-in cubes
  - 1/2 red onion, chopped
  - 2 poblano chiles, seeded, stemmed, and chopped
  - 1 jalapeño chile, sliced into thin rings
  - Kosher salt
  - Freshly ground black pepper
  - 4 green onions (white and green parts), thinly sliced
  - 1 bunch cilantro, leaves chopped and stems thinly sliced
  - 1 or 2 limes
instructions:
  - Heat a deep, heavy-bottomed pot over high heat. Add the coconut oil and let it melt and coat the bottom of the pan.
  - Add the sweet potato and stir to coat with oil, then sear, without stirring, until brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the cubes and sear, without stirring, 2 to 3 minutes.
  - Stir in the red onion, poblanos, and jalapeños; season with salt and pepper; and turn the heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion and chiles begin to brown and the potatoes are a deep, golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.
  - Test a potato for doneness; it should be crisp on the outside and soft and creamy inside. Stir in the green onions and cilantro. Taste for seasoning, and squeeze in lime juice to taste.
  - Transfer to a serving platter. Serve hot.
notes:
  - Perfect topped with an egg or served as a side dish.
  - Sweet potatoes should be crisp outside, soft and creamy inside.

## A Colorful Start to Your Day

There's something deeply satisfying about a well-made breakfast hash – the combination of crispy edges, tender centers, aromatic spices, and perfectly cooked eggs creates a harmonious dish that works any time of day. This sweet potato version elevates the classic diner staple with vibrant colors, complex flavors, and nutrient-dense ingredients.

What makes this hash special is the natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes balanced against smoky paprika and earthy cumin, creating a flavor profile that's both comforting and exciting. The addition of bell peppers brings freshness and crunch, while the runny egg yolks create a silky sauce that brings everything together.

This is a true one-pan wonder that's impressive enough for weekend brunch guests but simple enough for a nourishing weekday breakfast when you have a bit more time in the morning.

## Mastering the Perfect Hash

Creating a truly exceptional sweet potato hash comes down to a few key techniques:

- **Dice size matters**: Cutting the sweet potatoes into uniform 1/2-inch cubes ensures they cook evenly
- **Layer the ingredients**: Adding components in stages allows each to cook properly without some becoming overcooked
- **Don't overcrowd the pan**: Giving the sweet potatoes enough space allows them to develop crispy edges
- **Strategic stirring**: Resist the urge to constantly stir, which prevents proper browning
- **Egg wells**: Creating proper indentations helps keep the eggs contained during cooking
- **Covered cooking**: Using a lid to finish the dish cooks the eggs from above without overcooking the hash below

The result is a hash with a beautiful contrast of textures – crispy edges on the sweet potatoes, tender interiors, and silky egg yolks that create a natural sauce when broken.

## Nutritional Powerhouse

Beyond being delicious, this dish is packed with nutrients:

- **Sweet potatoes**: Rich in beta-carotene, vitamin C, potassium, and fiber
- **Bell peppers**: Excellent source of vitamins A and C, antioxidants, and folate
- **Eggs**: Provide high-quality protein, vitamin D, B vitamins, and choline
- **Avocado** (if included): Offers healthy fats, fiber, and potassium
- **Olive oil**: Contains heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and polyphenols

This combination makes for a balanced meal that provides sustained energy through complex carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats – perfect for an active day.

## Variations

### Southwest Sweet Potato Hash
Add 1 cup of black beans, 1/2 cup of corn kernels, and 1 diced jalapeño. Serve with cilantro and lime wedges for a Tex-Mex inspired breakfast.

### Mediterranean Hash
Add 1/2 cup diced zucchini, 1/4 cup sliced Kalamata olives, and 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano. Top with crumbled feta cheese before serving.

### Autumn Harvest Hash
Add 1 diced apple and 1/4 cup dried cranberries to the hash. Replace the thyme with sage and add a pinch of cinnamon for a fall-inspired variation.

### Greens & Sweet Potato Hash
Add 2 cups of chopped kale or spinach during the last 3-4 minutes of cooking for an extra boost of nutrients. This variation works particularly well with a sprinkle of goat cheese on top.

## Meal Prep Tips

This hash works beautifully as a meal prep option with a few adjustments:

- Prepare the vegetable hash portion without the eggs and refrigerate in portions
- When ready to eat, reheat a portion in a skillet until hot, then make a well and add a freshly cooked egg
- Alternatively, prepare individual portions in ramekins with the eggs already cooked for grab-and-go breakfasts that can be microwaved

With these strategies, you can enjoy this nourishing meal throughout the week with minimal morning effort.
