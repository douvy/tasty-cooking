## What is Za'atar?

Za'atar is a Middle Eastern spice blend that has been used for thousands of years, with variations found across Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Palestine, Israel, and other countries in the region. Traditional za'atar typically contains dried thyme, oregano, marjoram, sumac, sesame seeds, and salt, though exact proportions and additional ingredients vary by region and family recipe.

This California-inspired version maintains the core elements of traditional za'atar while incorporating ingredients that reflect California's agricultural bounty and culinary influences - citrus zest adds brightness, while pistachios contribute a nutty depth that complements the herbal base.

## Culinary Uses

California Za'atar is incredibly versatile and can be used in countless ways:

- **Olive Oil Dip**: Mix with good olive oil for bread dipping
- **Vegetable Seasoning**: Sprinkle on roasted vegetables before or after cooking
- **Protein Rub**: Use as a dry rub for chicken, fish, or tofu
- **Yogurt Mix-in**: Stir into plain yogurt for a quick dip or sauce
- **Avocado Toast**: Sprinkle on avocado toast for a flavor boost
- **Hummus Topping**: Dust over hummus for color and flavor
- **Grain Bowls**: Add to rice, quinoa, or other grain dishes
- **Salad Enhancer**: Mix into salad dressings or sprinkle directly on salads

## About the Ingredients

### Sumac
A deep red spice with a tart, lemony flavor that's essential to za'atar. It comes from grinding the dried berries of the sumac bush.

### Pistachios
A California twist on the traditional blend, adding richness and a subtle sweetness that balances the tangy sumac.

### Dried Citrus Zest
Another California-inspired addition that amplifies the citrus notes of the sumac while adding a distinctive brightness.

### Aleppo Pepper
Named after the Syrian city of Aleppo, these mild, fruity chili flakes add a gentle heat and complexity.

## Variations

### Traditional Za'atar
Omit the pistachios, citrus zest, and Aleppo pepper for a more traditional Middle Eastern blend.

### Spicy California Za'atar
Double the Aleppo pepper and add 1/4 teaspoon cayenne for a blend with more heat.

### Herbal-Forward Za'atar
Increase the thyme, oregano, and marjoram, and add 1 tablespoon dried mint for an even more aromatic blend.
