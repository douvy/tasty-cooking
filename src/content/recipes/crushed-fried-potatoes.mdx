  - Vegetable
ingredients:
  - 1½ pounds small medium-starch potatoes, such as Yukon Gold
  - Extra-virgin olive oil, for frying
  - 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
  - 1 tbsp fresh rosemary leaves
  - 1 tsp thyme leaves
  - Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
  - ¼ tsp dried chile flakes
  - 4 lemon wedges
instructions:
  - Heat the oven to 400°F.
  - Spread the potatoes on a baking sheet and bake until fully tender when poked with a knife, about 30 minutes, depending on size.
  - Let the potatoes cool enough to handle, then crush each one with your palm or the back of a pan to create a patty shape with lots of craggy surface area. For larger potatoes, tear into smaller pieces after smashing.
  - Heat ½ inch of olive oil in a large skillet until quite hot. Test the oil temperature by putting a corner of potato in - it should sizzle nicely when ready.
  - Working in batches, fry the potatoes until nicely browned on one side. Flip and cook until both sides are browned, about 5 minutes total.
  - About 30 seconds before the potatoes are done, add some of the garlic, rosemary, and thyme to the pan.
  - Transfer the potatoes to paper towels to drain. Continue frying remaining potatoes, scraping out herb bits between batches to prevent burning.
  - Season with salt, black pepper, and chile flakes. Serve with lemon wedges.
notes:
  - The key is creating maximum surface area when crushing for optimal crispiness.
  - Don't skip the initial baking - it ensures tender interiors.
  - Work in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan.

## The Art of Crushed Potatoes

This technique transforms humble potatoes into something extraordinary through a simple two-step process. First, the potatoes are baked until perfectly tender, then crushed and fried to create maximum crispy surface area while maintaining creamy centers.

The method likely emerged from resourceful cooks looking to reinvent leftover potatoes, but the result is far from an afterthought. The crushing creates irregular edges that become golden and crispy when fried, while the herb-infused oil adds aromatic complexity.

## Choosing the Right Potatoes

The success of this dish depends on selecting the proper potatoes:

- **Size**: Small to medium potatoes work best for even cooking
- **Variety**: Medium-starch potatoes like Yukon Gold provide the ideal balance of creaminess and structure
- **Freshness**: Firm potatoes without soft spots or sprouting eyes
- **Uniformity**: Choose potatoes of similar size for consistent cooking

## The Crushing Technique

The crushing step is crucial for achieving the signature texture:

- **Gentle Pressure**: Apply just enough force to flatten and crack the skin
- **Irregular Shapes**: Embrace the rustic, uneven appearance
- **Surface Area**: More craggy edges mean more crispy bits
- **Size Control**: Larger potatoes can be torn into smaller, manageable pieces

## Serving Suggestions

These crispy crushed potatoes are versatile enough to accompany various dishes:

- **Breakfast**: Serve alongside eggs and bacon for a hearty morning meal
- **Dinner**: Perfect as a side dish with roasted meats or grilled fish
- **Appetizer**: Offer as a shared starter with aioli or herb butter
- **Vegetarian Main**: Pair with a fresh salad for a satisfying meal
- **Holiday Table**: An elegant alternative to traditional mashed potatoes
