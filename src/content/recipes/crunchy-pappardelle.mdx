ingredients:
  - 1/4 cup olive oil
  - 3 1/2 cups button mushrooms, halved
  - 7 tbsp white wine
  - 1 bay leaf
  - 3 thyme sprigs, leaves picked and chopped
  - 1/2 tsp sugar
  - 2/3 cup heavy cream
  - salt and black pepper
  - grated zest of 1 lemon
  - 1 garlic clove, crushed
  - 3 tbsp chopped parsley
  - 3 tbsp panko
  - 1 bunch broccolini
  - 9 oz dried pappardelle
instructions:
  - Bring a large pot of salted water and a small pot of salted water to a boil. Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large saucepan and sauté the mushrooms until they start taking on color, stirring occasionally.
  - Add the wine, bay leaf, thyme and sugar. Bring to the boil and reduce the liquid by two-thirds. Add the cream and stir to mix. Taste and add plenty of salt and pepper. Keep warm.
  - Mix together the lemon zest, garlic and parsley. In a pan over medium heat, toast the panko until golden, stirring occasionally.
  - Pick any leaves from the broccolini, then cut into 2 1/2-inch-long pieces (stalks and florets). If the stalks are thick, cut them along the center in half or into quarters. Blanch in the small pot of boiling water for 2 minutes and drain.
  - Add the pasta to the large pot of boiling water. When the pasta is just ready, add the broccolini to the cream sauce to reheat. Drain the pappardelle, keeping some of the cooking liquid, and stir with the cream sauce; add half of the parsley mix. If the sauce seems dry, add some of the reserved cooking liquid.
  - Transfer the pasta to a serving bowl. Stir the rest of the parsley mix into the panko and sprinkle generously over the pappardelle, then serve immediately.
notes:
  - The sauce dries out easily, so add pasta cooking liquid to keep it runny before serving.
  - Toast the panko until golden for the best crunch.
  - Serve immediately while the panko is still crispy.

## A Symphony of Textures

Pappardelle pasta, with its broad, elegant ribbons, serves as the perfect canvas for this sophisticated yet comforting dish. The combination of a creamy walnut sauce with crispy breadcrumb topping creates a delightful contrast that makes each bite interesting and satisfying. This dish draws inspiration from the northern Italian tradition of walnut sauces, particularly from the regions of Liguria and Emilia-Romagna, where nuts are often incorporated into pasta preparations.

What sets this dish apart is its thoughtful layering of textures – the tender pasta, the velvety sauce clinging to each strand, and the crunchy breadcrumb and walnut topping that adds unexpected dimension. The aromatic elements of fresh herbs, lemon zest, and nutmeg elevate the nutty base notes, creating a complex flavor profile that feels far more sophisticated than the straightforward preparation would suggest.

While the presentation is elegant enough for a dinner party, this pasta comes together quickly enough for a weeknight meal, making it a versatile addition to any home cook's repertoire.

## The Art of Pasta Saucing

Creating the perfect balance between pasta and sauce requires attention to a few key details:

- **Properly salted pasta water**: The water should taste like the sea to properly season the pasta from within
- **Cooking to al dente**: Slightly firm pasta stands up better to the sauce and provides optimal texture
- **Reserved pasta water**: The starchy liquid helps bind the sauce to the pasta and adjust consistency
- **Finishing in the sauce**: Cooking the pasta and sauce together for the final minute allows the flavors to meld
- **Proper pasta-to-sauce ratio**: Each strand should be coated without drowning in sauce

The wide surface area of pappardelle is particularly well-suited to catching the textured walnut sauce, creating the perfect bite with each forkful.

## The Flavor of Walnuts

Walnuts provide more than just texture to this dish – they contribute a complex flavor profile that forms the foundation of the sauce:

- **Toasting**: Amplifies the nuts' natural oils and brings out their earthy sweetness
- **Bitterness balance**: The slight bitterness of walnuts is balanced by the cream and butter
- **Umami quality**: Walnuts contain natural glutamates that provide satisfying savory notes
- **Richness**: The high fat content of walnuts creates a luxurious mouthfeel similar to meat-based sauces

This makes walnut sauce an excellent option for vegetarian meals that still feel substantial and satisfying.

## Serving Suggestions

This versatile pasta works well in various dining contexts:

- **Simple dinner**: Serve with a crisp green salad dressed with vinaigrette
- **First course**: Offer smaller portions as a primo piatto before a simple protein main
- **Dinner party**: Pair with roasted vegetables and a medium-bodied white wine like Vermentino
- **Family style**: Place in a large serving bowl at the center of the table for sharing

For wine pairings, look to Italian whites with good acidity to cut through the richness of the sauce, or a light red like Barbera that won't overpower the walnut flavor.

## Variations

### Wild Mushroom and Walnut Pappardelle
Add 8 ounces of mixed wild mushrooms sautéed in butter before incorporating the walnut sauce for an earthy, autumnal variation.

### Walnut and Herb Pesto Pappardelle
Transform the sauce into more of a pesto by increasing the herbs and reducing the cream, creating a brighter, more herbaceous profile.

### Roasted Garlic and Walnut Pappardelle
Replace the raw garlic with a whole head of roasted garlic for a sweeter, more mellow garlic flavor that complements the walnuts beautifully.

### Walnut and Gorgonzola Pappardelle
Add 4 ounces of crumbled Gorgonzola dolce to the sauce for a tangy, creamy variation that pairs wonderfully with the crunchy breadcrumb topping.
