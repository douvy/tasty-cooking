  - Remove oil and sediment from pan, then add butter and melt. Add shallots, chiles, garlic and ginger.

  - Add the tofu to warm it up in the sauce for about a minute. Finally, stir in the green onions.
  - Serve hot, with steamed rice.
notes:
  - Use firm tofu for the best texture and frying results.
  - Adjust the heat level by using more or fewer chiles to your preference.
  - The key is to sauté the aromatics until they are completely soft and fragrant.

## Recipe Background

This Black Pepper Tofu recipe is inspired by Yotam Ottolenghi's famous version but has been simplified slightly for home cooks while maintaining the incredible flavor profile. The combination of butter, black pepper, and soy creates an irresistible savory coating for the crispy tofu.

## Chef's Tips

### Perfect Tofu Texture

The key to this dish is getting the tofu texture right. Here are some tips:
- Extra-firm tofu works best; avoid silken or soft varieties
- Press the tofu thoroughly to remove excess moisture
- Make sure your oil is hot enough before frying
- Don't crowd the pan when frying - work in batches

### Serving Suggestions

This dish is intensely flavored, so it pairs well with:
- Plain jasmine or basmati rice
- Simple steamed vegetables like bok choy or broccoli
- A cooling cucumber salad to balance the heat
