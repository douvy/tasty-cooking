## What is Mojo de Ajo?

Mojo de Ajo, which translates to "garlic sauce" in Spanish, is a staple in Mexican and Cuban cuisines. It's a versatile condiment consisting of garlic slowly cooked in olive oil until it becomes soft, mellow, and deeply flavorful. The addition of citrus juices brightens the flavor and helps preserve the garlic.

This condiment is much more than the sum of its parts - the slow cooking process transforms the sharp, pungent raw garlic into something sweeter, more complex, and incredibly versatile. The infused oil becomes as valuable as the soft garlic cloves themselves.

## Uses for Mojo de Ajo

This versatile condiment elevates almost any dish:

- **Seafood Enhancer**: Drizzle over grilled fish, shrimp, or scallops
- **Bread Dip**: Serve with warm crusty bread for an irresistible appetizer
- **Vegetable Finisher**: Spoon over roasted vegetables just before serving
- **Grain Enricher**: Stir into rice, quinoa, or other grains
- **Marinade Base**: Use as a foundation for meat or vegetable marinades
- **Pasta Sauce**: Toss with hot pasta and add fresh herbs for a quick meal

## Chef's Tips

For the best Mojo de Ajo:

1. **Low and Slow**: Cook over very low heat to develop flavor without burning the garlic
2. **Quality Ingredients**: Use good olive oil and fresh garlic for the best results
3. **Proper Storage**: Always refrigerate and use within two weeks, or freeze for longer storage
4. **Double Duty**: Use both the oil and the soft garlic cloves in your cooking
