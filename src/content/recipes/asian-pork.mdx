## A Versatile Foundation

This Asian pork is designed to be a building block for countless dishes. The deeply flavored, tender meat works beautifully in stir-fries, tucked into steamed buns, served over rice, or folded into noodle soups. The braising liquid itself becomes a flavorful stock worth saving.

## The Chinese 8 Spice Blend

The homemade spice blend is what sets this recipe apart. While you can substitute store-bought five-spice powder, making your own allows you to control the balance of flavors and ensures maximum freshness. The combination of star anise, Szechuan peppercorns, and fennel creates that distinctive warming quality that defines Chinese braised meats.

## Scaling the Recipe

This is a large-batch recipe designed for meal prep or feeding a crowd. It scales down easily:
- For 7 lbs pork, halve all ingredients
- For 3.5 lbs pork, quarter all ingredients
- Adjust braising time accordingly for smaller batches
