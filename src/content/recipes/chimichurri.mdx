## What is Chimichurri?

Chimichurri is a vibrant, uncooked sauce that originated in Argentina and Uruguay, where it's traditionally served with grilled meats. Its bright, tangy flavor and fresh herbal notes make it an exceptional condiment that cuts through the richness of beef and other grilled proteins.

The sauce has a perfect balance of acidity from the vinegar and lemon juice, heat from the red pepper flakes, and richness from the olive oil, all anchored by the fresh herbs and pungent garlic.

## Serving Suggestions

While chimichurri is classically paired with grilled steak, its versatility extends far beyond beef:

- **Grilled Proteins**: Drizzle over steak, chicken, pork, lamb, or fish
- **Roasted Vegetables**: Spoon over roasted potatoes, carrots, or cauliflower
- **Grain Bowls**: Use as a flavorful sauce for rice or quinoa bowls
- **Eggs**: Add brightness to scrambled eggs or omelets
- **Sandwiches**: Spread on bread as a flavorful alternative to mayonnaise
- **Marinade**: Use as a marinade for meat, poultry, or vegetables before grilling

## Variations

### Red Chimichurri (Chimichurri Rojo)
Add 1 tablespoon of smoked paprika and substitute half the parsley with roasted red peppers.

### Cilantro-Heavy Chimichurri
Use equal parts cilantro and parsley for a different herbal profile.

### Basil Chimichurri
Substitute half the parsley with fresh basil leaves for a sweeter, more aromatic sauce.
