title: Charred Brussels Sprouts with Bacon & Dates
description: For this recipe, look for smaller-than-golf-ball-size sprouts that are firm and tight. Be patient and let them get a good char on the cut side, almost to the point of burning. It brings a toasty, nutty flavor that contrasts with the sweet dates and sharp vinegar. You may have to adjust the cooking time to accommodate smaller sprouts, in early winter, or the larger ones as they mature throughout the season. Generally leave very tiny ones whole and quarter the larger ones.

ingredients:
  - 3 oz bacon, cut into 1/4-in wide matchsticks
  - 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
  - 1 lb Brussels sprouts, halved through the stem end
  - Â¼ cup pitted soft fresh dates
  - 1 cup chicken stock
  - 1 tbsp plus 1 tsp red wine vinegar
  - Kosher salt
  - Freshly ground black pepper
instructions:
  - Heat a large cast-iron frying pan over medium-high heat, and cook the bacon with the olive oil until the bacon has rendered most of its fat but is still juicy, ~10 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate, and increase the heat to high. If there is excessive fat in the pan, you can drain some, but reserve in case the pan dries out. The sprouts will absorb the fat.
  - Add the Brussels sprouts to the pan, cut side down. Sear without shaking the pan until well-charred and beginning to blacken, 5-7 minutes. Flip the Brussels sprouts and season with salt and pepper.
  - Add the dates and reserved bacon to the pan, toss well, and cook until the sprouts begin to color, 2-3 minutes. Gradually add the stock to the pan. Use a wooden spoon to smash the dates into the sauce as it reduces. Once the dates are incorporated, add the vinegar.
  - Continue cooking until the sauce thickens enough to coat the Brussels sprouts, 2-3 minutes. Be careful not to reduce the sauce too much. The sprouts should remain bright green and somewhat firm inside, but tender to the bite.
  - Transfer to a serving platter. Serve warm.
notes:
  - Look for smaller-than-golf-ball-size sprouts that are firm and tight.
  - Be patient and let them get a good char on the cut side, almost to the point of burning for the best flavor.
  - Adjust cooking time based on sprout size - leave tiny ones whole and quarter larger ones.

## Why People Love These Brussels Sprouts

Even those who claim to dislike Brussels sprouts often change their minds after trying this recipe. The high-heat roasting method caramelizes the natural sugars in the vegetables, creating crispy edges with a sweet, nutty flavor that contrasts beautifully with their tender centers.

The addition of balsamic vinegar and honey creates a glaze that balances the slight bitterness of the sprouts with tangy sweetness, while the garlic adds depth and complexity to the dish.

## Choosing the Best Brussels Sprouts

For optimal results, look for:

- **Size**: Small to medium Brussels sprouts tend to be sweeter and more tender
- **Color**: Bright green sprouts with tightly packed leaves
- **Freshness**: Firm sprouts that feel heavy for their size
- **Appearance**: Avoid sprouts with yellowing leaves, black spots, or insect holes

## Serving Suggestions

These charred Brussels sprouts pair well with:

- **Proteins**: Roasted chicken, grilled steak, or baked salmon
- **Grains**: Wild rice, quinoa, or farro
- **Holiday Meals**: A perfect side dish for Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner
- **Brunch**: Alongside eggs and bacon for a hearty weekend meal

## Variations

### Balsamic Bacon Brussels Sprouts
Cook 4 slices of chopped bacon until crispy, then use the bacon fat instead of olive oil to roast the sprouts. Toss with the cooked bacon pieces before serving.

### Asian-Inspired Brussels Sprouts
