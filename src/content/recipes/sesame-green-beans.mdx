## Chef's Tips

These sesame green beans are perfect as a side dish for grilled salmon or chicken. The combination of the nutty sesame seeds and the creamy tahini creates a rich, satisfying flavor that elevates the simple green beans.

For the best texture, it's crucial not to overcook the green beans. The quick blanching followed by an ice bath ensures they remain crisp and bright green.

You can prepare this dish up to a day ahead and store it in the refrigerator. The flavors actually improve as they meld together overnight.
