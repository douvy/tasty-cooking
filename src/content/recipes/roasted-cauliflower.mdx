ingredients:
  - 1 head cauliflower, trimmed and chopped into large florets
  - ⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil
  - Kosher salt
  - Freshly ground black pepper
  - 3 cloves garlic
  - 2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley
  - ¼ tsp crushed red pepper flakes
  - 2 tbsp red wine vinegar
instructions:
  - Preheat the oven to 500°F.
  - In a medium bowl, toss the cauliflower with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
  - Heat a large cast-iron frying pan over high heat. Dump the cauliflower into the hot pan and cook until starting to brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast the cauliflower, undisturbed, until well seared, ~5 minutes longer. With a spatula, turn the cauliflower and cook on the other side until well seared, ~3 minutes longer.
  - While the cauliflower is roasting, finely chop the 3 cloves of garlic.
  - Remove the pan from the oven, add the chopped garlic, and return the pan to the oven for an additional 2-3 minutes. This will ensure the garlic cooks through and loses its raw edge.
  - After the additional cooking time, add the parsley, red pepper flakes, and vinegar, and stir to distribute the seasonings and toast the garlic slightly. Season with salt and pepper.
  - Transfer to a serving platter. Serve warm or at room temperature.
notes:
  - The key is getting a good char to caramelize the natural sugars.
  - Use a cast-iron pan for best searing results.
  - Can be served warm or at room temperature.

## The Magic of Roasted Cauliflower

Roasting transforms cauliflower from a humble vegetable into something extraordinary. The high heat caramelizes the natural sugars in the cauliflower, creating crispy, golden edges with tender, sweet interiors. The addition of spices adds depth and complexity, while the final touch of lemon juice brightens all the flavors.

Unlike steamed or boiled cauliflower, which can be bland and watery, roasted cauliflower develops a rich, nutty flavor that makes it satisfying enough to be the star of a meal, not just a side dish.

## Choosing the Perfect Cauliflower

For the best roasted cauliflower:

- **Freshness**: Look for a head that's firm and heavy for its size
- **Color**: Choose cauliflower with creamy white florets without brown spots
- **Leaves**: Fresh, green leaves that aren't wilted indicate freshness
- **Compactness**: The florets should be tightly packed, not spreading apart

## Serving Suggestions

Roasted cauliflower is incredibly versatile and pairs well with a variety of dishes:

- **Grain Bowls**: Add to quinoa or rice bowls with other roasted vegetables
- **Salads**: Toss into salads warm or cold for added texture and flavor
- **Pasta**: Mix with pasta, olive oil, and Parmesan cheese for a simple meal
- **Wraps**: Use in wraps or pitas with hummus and fresh vegetables
- **Main Course**: Serve a larger portion as a vegetarian main dish over pureed beans or lentils
- **Side Dish**: Accompany grilled or roasted meats and fish
