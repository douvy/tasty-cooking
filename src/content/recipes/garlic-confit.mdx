## What is Garlic Confit?

"Confit" is a French cooking technique that involves slowly cooking an ingredient in fat at a low temperature. Garlic confit transforms pungent raw garlic into something completely different - soft, creamy cloves with a mellow, sweet flavor that lacks the sharp bite of fresh garlic.

The slow cooking process caramelizes the natural sugars in the garlic while the oil prevents it from burning, resulting in a delicate, nutty flavor profile. As an added bonus, the oil becomes infused with garlic flavor, creating two culinary ingredients from one process.

## Uses for Garlic Confit

The soft garlic cloves can be used in countless ways:

- **Spread on Toast**: Mash onto crusty bread as an alternative to butter
- **Enrich Sauces**: Stir into pasta sauces, soups, or stews
- **Enhance Dips**: Blend into hummus, baba ganoush, or yogurt dips
- **Mashed Potatoes**: Fold into mashed potatoes for incredible depth of flavor
- **Compound Butter**: Mix with softened butter, herbs, and salt for an amazing compound butter

The infused oil is equally versatile:

- **Dressings**: Use as the base for vinaigrettes and dressings
- **Drizzling**: Finish dishes with a drizzle before serving
- **Sautéing**: Use for cooking vegetables or proteins
- **Marinades**: Incorporate into marinades for meat or vegetables
- **Bread Dip**: Serve with balsamic vinegar as a dip for fresh bread

## Important Food Safety Note

While delicious, garlic confit must be handled properly:

1. Always refrigerate promptly after cooling
2. Use within two weeks
3. Never leave at room temperature for extended periods
4. Always use clean utensils when retrieving from the jar

These precautions help prevent the risk of botulism, which can occur in low-acid, oxygen-free environments like oil-preserved garlic.

## Variations

### Herb-Infused Garlic Confit
Add additional herbs like rosemary, sage, or oregano for different flavor profiles.

### Citrus Garlic Confit
Add strips of lemon or orange zest to infuse a subtle citrus note into both the oil and garlic.

### Spicy Garlic Confit
Increase the red pepper flakes to 1 teaspoon and add a sliced fresh chili for a spicier version.
