  - Vegetarian
  - Condiments
ingredients:
  - About 2 cups mushroom stems and trimmings, preferably wild mushrooms, wiped to remove any grit or debris
  - 1 garlic clove, smashed and peeled
  - 1 sprig thyme
  - ½ lb unsalted butter, at room temperature
  - 1 tbsp finely chopped flat-leaf parsley
  - ½ tsp minced fresh rosemary
  - ¼ tsp dried chile flakes
  - ½ tsp kosher salt
instructions:
  - Put the mushrooms in a medium saucepan. Add the garlic, thyme, and water to cover by ½ inch.
  - Bring to a simmer and cook until you sense that all the mushroom flavor has leached into the water (do a taste test), about 1 hour.
  - Strain the mushroom cooking liquid into a bowl and discard the solids.
  - Return the mushroom liquid to the pan and simmer to reduce it to a glaze, about 2 tablespoons.
  - Cool the mushroom glaze completely, then blend it into the softened butter along with the parsley, rosemary, chile flakes, and salt, using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula.
  - Pile into whatever container you want to serve or save it in.
  - Chill the butter for at least 1 hour to firm it up and to let the flavors marry and permeate the butter.
notes:
  - Stockpile mushroom stems in the freezer until ready to use.
  - Taste the cooking liquid to ensure maximum flavor extraction.
  - The glaze must be completely cool before mixing with butter to prevent melting.

## The Art of Mushroom Compound Butter

This compound butter elevates the humble mushroom stem into something extraordinary. Rather than discarding the stems and trimmings from mushrooms, this technique captures their concentrated earthy flavor through a slow simmering process that extracts every bit of mushroom essence.

The process involves creating an intensely flavored mushroom glaze that gets incorporated into rich butter along with fresh herbs. The result is a complex, umami-rich spread that brings depth to everything it touches.

## Making the Most of Mushroom Scraps

This recipe is particularly valuable for home cooks who want to minimize waste:

- **Stem Collection**: Save stems from any mushroom preparation and store them in the freezer
- **Wild Mushroom Preservation**: Perfect way to capture the flavor of seasonal wild mushrooms
- **Economic Cooking**: Transforms what would be discarded into a gourmet ingredient
- **Flavor Concentration**: The long simmering and reduction intensifies the mushroom taste

## Choosing Your Mushrooms

While any mushroom stems work, different varieties will create distinct flavors:

- **Wild Mushrooms**: Porcini, chanterelles, and morels create the most complex flavors
- **Shiitake**: Adds a deep, meaty umami character
- **Cremini/Button**: Provides a clean, earthy base flavor
- **Mixed Varieties**: Combining different mushroom types creates depth and complexity

## Storage and Uses

This versatile compound butter keeps well and has countless applications:

### Storage
- **Refrigerator**: Up to 1 week in an airtight container
- **Freezer**: Up to 3 months, wrapped tightly
- **Portioning**: Roll in parchment paper and slice as needed

### Serving Suggestions
- **Steaks and Chops**: Melt over grilled or pan-seared meats
- **Vegetables**: Toss with roasted or sautéed vegetables
- **Bread**: Spread on crusty bread or dinner rolls
- **Pasta**: Toss with simple pasta for an instant sauce
- **Risotto**: Stir in at the end for extra richness
- **Eggs**: Add to scrambled eggs or omelets

## Variations

### Truffle Mushroom Butter
Add 1 teaspoon of truffle oil or finely chopped fresh truffle to the finished butter.

### Wine-Enhanced Mushroom Butter
Replace half the water with dry white wine during the initial simmering for added complexity.

### Herb-Forward Mushroom Butter
Double the fresh herbs and add chopped chives for a more herbaceous flavor profi
