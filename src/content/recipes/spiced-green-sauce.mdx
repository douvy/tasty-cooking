ingredients:
  - ½ tsp coriander seeds
  - 1 tsp cumin seeds
  - Seeds from 4 green or black cardamom pods
  - ½ cup deribbed, seeded, and roughly chopped fresh hot green chiles, such as serrano (2 to 4)
  - 1 to 3 garlic cloves (to taste), smashed and peeled
  - 2 cups lightly packed cilantro leaves
  - 2 cups lightly packed flat-leaf parsley leaves
  - A pinch of ground cloves
  - 1 tsp finely grated lemon zest
  - About 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
  - Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
  - ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil
instructions:
  - Put the coriander, cumin, and cardamom seeds into a dry skillet. Toast lightly over medium heat, shaking the pan frequently, until fragrant, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool, then grind finely in a spice grinder or mortar and pestle.
  - Put the chiles and garlic in a food processor and pulse a few times until fairly fine. Add the cilantro, parsley, toasted ground seeds, ground cloves, lemon zest, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, and a few twists of black pepper.
  - Pulse until all ingredients are finely chopped into a rough puree. With the motor running, drizzle in the olive oil. Stop before the sauce is completely smooth—you want a slightly chunky texture.
  - Taste carefully and adjust seasoning with more salt, pepper, lemon juice, or spices as needed. Store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

## The Heritage of Green Sauces

Vibrant herb-based green sauces exist in culinary traditions around the world – from Italian salsa verde to Argentinian chimichurri, Indian chutney to Mexican salsa verde. This particular recipe draws inspiration from zhoug (also spelled zhug or skhug), a Yemenite hot sauce that has become a staple in Israeli and Middle Eastern cuisine.

What distinguishes this green sauce is its balanced flavor profile that combines the fresh brightness of herbs with the depth of warm spices. The cumin, coriander, cardamom, and cloves add complexity that transforms the sauce from a simple herb blend into something truly special. The jalapeños provide heat that can be adjusted to your preference, making this sauce adaptable to different palates.

## The Power of Fresh Herbs

The foundation of this sauce is the generous use of fresh herbs:

- **Cilantro**: Provides the distinctive, bright flavor base with citrusy notes
- **Parsley**: Adds a clean, grassy element and helps balance the cilantro
- **Garlic**: Contributes pungency and depth
- **Jalapeños**: Bring heat and vegetal notes
- **Spices**: Add warmth and complexity

Together, these ingredients create a symphony of flavors that's simultaneously fresh, spicy, and complex. The olive oil binds everything together and helps preserve the herbs while adding richness.

## Serving Suggestions

This versatile sauce enhances a wide variety of dishes:

- **Grilled Meats**: Drizzle over chicken, lamb, or beef
- **Roasted Vegetables**: Spoon over roasted cauliflower, carrots, or sweet potatoes
- **Grain Bowls**: Add a spoonful to quinoa, rice, or farro bowls
- **Eggs**: Serve with fried or scrambled eggs for a flavorful breakfast
- **Sandwiches**: Spread on wraps or pitas instead of mayonnaise
- **Dips**: Swirl into hummus or yogurt for an instant upgrade
- **Soups**: Add a spoonful to lentil or vegetable soup just before serving

## Variations

### Green Herb Tahini Sauce
Add 2 tablespoons of tahini for a creamier sauce with nutty depth.

### Preserved Lemon Green Sauce
Replace the lemon juice with 1 tablespoon of finely chopped preserved lemon rind for a more complex citrus flavor.

### Harissa-Style Green Sauce
Add 1 teaspoon of smoked paprika and 1/2 teaspoon of caraway seeds for a sauce that bridges the gap between zhoug and harissa.
