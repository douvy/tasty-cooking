  - title: For the Cakes
    items:
      - 2¼ lbs peeled sweet potatoes, cut into large chunks
      - scant ¾ cup all-purpose flour
      - 1 tsp salt
      - ½ tsp sugar
      - 3 tbsp chopped green onion
      - ½ tsp finely chopped fresh red chile (or more if you want them hot)
      - 2 tsp soy sauce
      - plenty of butter for frying
  - title: For the Sauce
    items:
      - 3 tbsp Greek yogurt
      - 3 tbsp sour cream
      - 2 tbsp olive oil
      - 1 tbsp lemon juice
      - 1 tbsp chopped cilantro
      - salt and black pepper
instructions:
  - Steam the sweet potatoes until completely soft, then leave in a colander to drain for at least an hour.
  - To make the sauce - Whisk together all the sauce ingredients until smooth; set aside.
  - Once the sweet potatoes have lost most of their liquid, place them in a mixing bowl and add the flour, salt, sugar, green onion, chile, and soy sauce. Mix everything together by hand until smooth and even; do not over-mix. The mixture should be sticky; if it's runny add some more flour.
  - Melt some butter in a non-stick frying pan. For each cake, use a tablespoon to lift some mix into the pan and flatten with the back of the spoon to create a disc that is roughly 2 inches in diameter and ⅜ inch thick.
  - Fry the cakes on medium heat for about 6 minutes on each side, or until you get a nice brown crust.
  - Place between two sheets of paper towels to soak up excess butter. Serve hot or warm, with the sauce on the side.
notes:
  - Inspired by a famous Tel Aviv café.
  - Sweet potatoes must drain for at least an hour to remove excess moisture.
  - Serve hot or warm with tangy yogurt sauce on the side.

## A Versatile Dish with Global Influence

Sweet potato cakes represent the beautiful intersection of comfort food and culinary sophistication. Drawing inspiration from Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisines, these cakes transform the humble sweet potato into an elevated dish that can serve as an appetizer, side, or even the star of a vegetarian meal.

What makes these cakes special is the contrast between the crispy exterior and the tender, flavorful interior. The natural sweetness of the potatoes is balanced by warm spices and aromatics, while the cooling herb yogurt provides the perfect counterpoint. The result is a dish with complex flavors that still feels accessible and comforting.

While not traditional in any single cuisine, these sweet potato cakes borrow elements from Lebanese potato cakes, Indian tikki, and Jewish latkes to create something uniquely delicious that feels both familiar and exciting.

## Mastering the Technique

The difference between mediocre and outstanding sweet potato cakes comes down to a few key technical points:

- **Moisture control**: Sweet potatoes naturally contain a lot of moisture, which must be removed to achieve crispiness. Don't skip the step of squeezing them dry.
- **Binding agents**: The combination of eggs, flour, and cornstarch creates the perfect structure that holds together during cooking but remains tender.
- **Proper heat**: Maintaining medium heat ensures the cakes cook through without burning on the outside while still raw inside.
- **Don't crowd the pan**: Cooking in batches ensures each cake has room to develop a proper crust.
- **Resting the mixture**: Allowing the mixture to rest before cooking gives the flour time to absorb moisture and the flavors time to develop.

The other secret to these cakes is the balance of spices. The combination of cumin, coriander, paprika, and cinnamon creates a warm, complex flavor profile that elevates the sweet potato beyond its natural sweetness into something truly craveable.

## Serving Suggestions

These versatile sweet potato cakes can be served in numerous ways:

- **Appetizer**: Serve smaller versions with the herb yogurt as an elegant starter
- **Side dish**: Pair with grilled meats or fish for a complete meal
- **Main course**: Serve 3-4 cakes with a green salad for a satisfying vegetarian meal
- **Brunch**: Top with a poached egg for a weekend brunch centerpiece
- **Sandwich**: Use as a patty in a vegetarian burger with avocado and greens

For an impressive spread, serve alongside other Middle Eastern mezze like hummus, baba ganoush, and tabbouleh.

## Variations

### Curry Sweet Potato Cakes
Replace the cumin-based spice blend with 2 teaspoons of curry powder and add 1/4 cup of frozen peas for an Indian-inspired variation.

### Southwest Sweet Potato Cakes
Add 1/2 cup of corn kernels, 1/2 cup of black beans, and replace the herb blend with southwestern spices like chili powder and oregano. Serve with avocado crema instead of herb yogurt.

### Breakfast Sweet Potato Cakes
Add 1/4 cup of chopped cooked bacon or ham and a sprinkle of cheese to the mixture for a breakfast version that pairs perfectly with eggs.
