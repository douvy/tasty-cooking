ingredients:
  - 3 bunches Broccolini
  - 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
  - 3 cloves garlic
  - ½ tsp crushed red pepper flakes
  - 2 Tbsp red wine vinegar
  - Kosher salt
  - Freshly ground black pepper
instructions:
  - If the Broccolini stems are thicker than 3/4 in, prepare an ice-water bath by filling a large bowl with cold water and ice. Blanch the Broccolini in lightly salted boiling water for about 15 seconds and plunge them into the ice-water bath to stop the cooking. (If your Broccolini stems are not thick, skip this step.)
  - Preheat your oven to 450°F
  - In a medium bowl, toss the Broccolini with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
  - Spread the Broccolini on a baking sheet in a single layer. Roast in the oven until they start to crisp and turn brown, about 8-10 minutes. Flip the Broccolini and roast on the other side for an additional 5-7 minutes until well seared.
  - While the Broccolini is roasting, finely chop the garlic cloves.
  - Remove the baking sheet from the oven, add the chopped garlic, red pepper flakes, and vinegar to the Broccolini, and toss well. Return to the oven for an additional 2-3 minutes to allow the garlic to cook through and become fragrant.
  - Transfer to a serving platter. Serve hot or at room temperature.
notes:
  - Blanch only if stems are thicker than 3/4 inch.
  - Can be served hot or at room temperature.
  - Adjust red pepper flakes to taste preference.

## What is Broccolini?

Broccolini is a relatively new vegetable, developed in the 1990s as a hybrid between regular broccoli and Chinese kale (gai lan). The result is a vegetable with long, slender stalks topped with small florets that have a sweeter, milder flavor than traditional broccoli.

The entire vegetable is edible from the tips of the florets to the bottom of the stalks, making it more versatile and reducing waste compared to regular broccoli. Its tender texture and quick cooking time make it perfect for high-heat cooking methods like grilling, which enhances its natural sweetness while adding smoky, charred notes.

## Why Blanch Before Grilling?

Blanching broccolini before grilling serves several purposes:

1. **Even Cooking**: It partially cooks the stalks so they'll finish at the same time as the delicate florets
2. **Color Preservation**: The quick cooking and ice bath help maintain the vibrant green color
3. **Texture**: The blanching softens the stalks just enough while allowing them to retain some crispness
4. **Char Development**: Dry broccolini will char better than raw broccolini directly on the grill

This extra step only adds a few minutes to your preparation time but significantly improves the final result.

## Serving Suggestions

Grilled broccolini is a versatile side dish that pairs well with:

- **Proteins**: Grilled steak, roasted chicken, or seared fish
- **Pasta**: Alongside or tossed with pasta and a light sauce
- **Grains**: Served over quinoa, farro, or rice for a complete meal
- **Eggs**: Alongside fried or poached eggs for a breakfast or brunch option
- **Platters**: As part of an antipasto or grilled vegetable platter
