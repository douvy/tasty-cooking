  - title: Makes 2 cups
    items:
      - 3 lb tomatoes, such as Roma or Early Girl
      - Kosher salt
      - 10 garlic cloves, smashed
      - 10 fresh thyme sprigs
      - 1 tbsp dried oregano
      - Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes
      - 2 cups extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed
      - 1/4 cup loosely packed fresh basil leaves
instructions:
  - Preheat the oven to 250°F. Bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat. Prepare an ice-water bath by filling a large bowl with ice water.
  - Use a paring knife to score a small X in the bottom of each tomato. Plunge the tomatoes into the boiling water for 20 seconds, and immediately transfer them to the ice-water bath. Work in batches, if necessary, until all the tomatoes have been blanched.
  - When the tomatoes are cool, remove them from the water. With a sharp paring knife, peel the skin from the tomatoes; it should slip off easily. Cut the tomatoes into halves or quarters, depending on size, and gently pull the seeds out with your fingers. The tomatoes do not need to be perfectly seedless, but do your best to clean them so just the tomato flesh remains.
  - Place the tomatoes in a shallow baking dish or roasting pan and season with salt. Scatter the garlic, thyme, oregano, red pepper flakes, and basil leaves over the tomatoes. Pour the olive oil over all. Bake until the tomatoes are shriveled and browned around the edges, 3 to 4 hours. Turn them and move them around occasionally while baking so that the tomatoes closest to the edge of the pan don't burn. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature.
  - Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 month, completely covered with olive oil to prevent air from reaching them.
notes:
  - Versatile preserved tomatoes that can be used year-round.
  - Use the flavored tomato oil on dishes that benefit from olive oil and tomato flavor.
  - Store covered with olive oil for up to 1 month in refrigerator.

## What is Confit?

"Confit" is a French cooking technique that involves slow-cooking food in fat at a low temperature. While traditionally associated with preserving duck and other meats, the method works beautifully with vegetables - especially tomatoes.

This slow-cooking process concentrates the natural sugars in the tomatoes, creating intense umami flavors while maintaining their integrity. The result is a versatile condiment that adds a burst of concentrated summer tomato flavor to any dish, even during winter months when fresh tomatoes are lackluster.

## Selecting the Best Tomatoes

For the most flavorful tomato confit:

- **Variety**: Cherry or grape tomatoes work best due to their higher sugar content and lower water content
- **Ripeness**: Choose fully ripe, firm tomatoes without bruises
- **Color**: A mix of red, yellow, and orange cherry tomatoes creates a beautiful presentation
- **Size**: Select tomatoes of similar size so they cook evenly
- **Season**: In-season summer tomatoes will yield the most flavorful results, but this technique also transforms off-season tomatoes into something special

## Serving Suggestions

Tomato confit is incredibly versatile and can elevate simple dishes to gourmet status:

- **Pasta**: Toss with hot pasta and fresh basil for a simple, flavorful sauce
- **Bruschetta**: Spread on toasted bread with a layer of ricotta or goat cheese
- **Grain Bowls**: Add to quinoa, farro, or other grain bowls for a flavor boost
- **Eggs**: Serve alongside scrambled eggs or fold into an omelet
- **Sandwiches**: Layer on sandwiches or panini instead of fresh tomatoes
- **Proteins**: Serve alongside grilled chicken, fish, or steak
- **Charcuterie**: Include on a cheese board with olives and cured meats

## Variations

### Balsamic Tomato Confit
Add 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar to the oil before roasting for a sweet-tangy variation.

### Spicy Tomato Confit
Increase the red pepper flakes to 1 teaspoon and add a sliced fresh jalapeño or serrano pepper.

### Citrus-Herb Tomato Confit
Add strips of lemon or orange zest and double the herbs for a brighter, more aromatic version.
