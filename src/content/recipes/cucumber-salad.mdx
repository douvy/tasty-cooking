    items:
      - 3 tbsp rice wine vinegar
      - 2 tsp sugar
      - 2 tbsp sunflower oil
      - 2 tsp toasted sesame oil
instructions:
  - Whisk together all dressing ingredients in a medium mixing bowl. Add the sliced red onion, mix well and leave aside to marinate for about an hour.
  - Place the ginger and salt in a mortar and pound well with a pestle. Add the garlic and continue pounding until well crushed and broken into pieces (stop before it becomes a paste).
  - Use a spatula to scrape the mortar contents into the bowl with the onion and dressing. Stir together.
  - Cut the cucumbers lengthways in half, then cut each half on an angle into ¼-inch-thick slices.
  - Add the cucumber to the bowl, followed by the sesame seeds and cilantro. Stir well and leave to sit for 10 minutes.
  - Before serving, stir the salad again, tip out some of the liquid that has accumulated at the bottom of the bowl and adjust the seasoning.
notes:
  - Let the red onion marinate in the dressing for a full hour for best flavor.
  - Stop pounding the garlic and ginger before it becomes a paste - you want pieces, not puree.
  - This salad pairs perfectly with rich, hearty dishes.

## A Timeless Summer Classic

Cucumber salad is one of those deceptively simple dishes that has stood the test of time across many cultures. From German Gurkensalat to Asian cucumber salads with rice vinegar, this refreshing side dish appears in some form on tables around the world – and for good reason. The cool, crisp texture of cucumbers combined with a bright, tangy dressing creates the perfect counterpoint to rich, heavy main courses and offers welcome relief on hot summer days.

What makes this particular cucumber salad special is the balance of flavors and textures – the crunch of fresh cucumber, the tang of vinegar, the subtle heat from black pepper and optional red pepper flakes, and the aromatic freshness of dill. The touch of sweetness in the dressing helps round out the acidity, creating a perfectly balanced bite every time.

While simple to prepare, this salad benefits from a few key techniques that elevate it from good to exceptional.

## Techniques for the Perfect Cucumber Salad

The difference between an ordinary cucumber salad and an extraordinary one comes down to a few simple but crucial steps:

- **Salting the cucumbers**: This step draws out excess moisture, preventing a watery salad and intensifying the cucumber flavor
- **Thin, consistent slices**: Whether you use a mandoline or a sharp knife, aim for uniform, paper-thin slices that allow the dressing to penetrate evenly
- **Balancing the dressing**: The ideal ratio of vinegar to oil to sugar creates a dressing that's tangy but not too sharp
- **Resting time**: Allowing the salad to sit before serving gives the flavors time to meld and develop
- **Fresh herbs**: Using fresh rather than dried dill makes a significant difference in the brightness of flavor

Taking the time to properly salt and drain the cucumbers might seem fussy, but it's the secret to a salad that stays crisp rather than becoming soggy with released cucumber water.

## Cultural Variations

Cucumber salads appear in cuisines around the world, each with their own distinctive twist:

- **German Gurkensalat**: Similar to this recipe but often with a sour cream dressing
- **Greek Tzatziki**: Combines cucumbers with yogurt, garlic, and herbs
- **Japanese Sunomono**: Uses rice vinegar and sometimes wakame seaweed
- **Thai Cucumber Salad**: Features fish sauce, lime, and chilies for a spicy-sour profile
- **Hungarian Cucumber Salad**: Includes paprika and sometimes sour cream
- **Korean Oi Muchim**: Spiced with gochugaru (Korean chili flakes) and sesame oil

## Variations

### Creamy Cucumber Dill Salad
Add 1/3 cup of sour cream or Greek yogurt to the dressing for a creamy variation that pairs beautifully with spicy main dishes.

### Asian-Inspired Cucumber Salad
Replace the white wine vinegar with rice vinegar, add 1 teaspoon of sesame oil, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, and garnish with sesame seeds for an Asian-inspired variation.

### Mediterranean Cucumber Salad
Add halved cherry tomatoes, Kalamata olives, and increase the feta cheese for a Mediterranean twist that works well as a light lunch on its own.

### Cucumber Dill Gazpacho
Blend half of this salad with cold vegetable broth for a refreshing cold soup perfect for the hottest summer days.
