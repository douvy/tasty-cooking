ingredients:
  - 2 large and long eggplants
  - ⅓ cup olive oil
  - 1½ tsp lemon thyme leaves, plus a few whole sprigs to garnish
  - Maldon sea salt and black pepper
  - 1 pomegranate
  - 1 tsp za'atar
ingredients_subsections:
  - title: Sauce
    items:
      - 9 tbsp buttermilk
      - ½ cup Greek yogurt
      - 1½ tbsp olive oil, plus a drizzle to finish
      - 1 small garlic clove, crushed
      - pinch of salt
instructions:
  - Preheat the oven to 200°F. Cut the eggplants in half lengthways, cutting straight through the green stalk. Use a small sharp knife to make three or four parallel incisions in the cut side of each eggplant half, without cutting through to the skin. Repeat at a 45-degree angle to get a diamond-shaped pattern.
  - Place the eggplant halves, cut-side up, on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush them with olive oil - keep on brushing until all of the oil has been absorbed by the flesh. Sprinkle with the lemon thyme leaves and some salt and pepper.
  - Roast for 35 to 40 minutes, at which point the flesh should be soft, flavorful and nicely browned. Remove from the oven and allow to cool down completely.
  - While the eggplants are in the oven, cut the pomegranate into two horizontally. Hold one half over a bowl, with the cut side against your palm, and use the back of a wooden spoon to gently knock on the pomegranate skin. Continue beating with increasing power until the seeds start coming out naturally and falling through your fingers into the bowl. Sift through the seeds to remove any bits of white skin or membrane.
  - To make the sauce, whisk together all of the sauce ingredients. Taste for seasoning, then keep cold until needed.
  - To serve, spoon plenty of buttermilk sauce over the eggplant halves without covering the stalks. Sprinkle za'atar and plenty of pomegranate seeds on top and garnish with lemon thyme. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil.
notes:
  - Perfect with warm bread or pita as a starter.
  - The eggplant should be completely cooled before serving.
  - Make sure to remove all white membrane from pomegranate seeds.

## A Dish of Beautiful Contrasts

This Roasted Eggplant with Buttermilk Sauce is a stunning example of how contrasting flavors, textures, and colors can create a truly memorable dish. Inspired by the brilliant Middle Eastern-influenced cuisine of chef Yotam Ottolenghi, this recipe transforms the humble eggplant into something extraordinary through thoughtful preparation and an artful combination of complementary elements.

What makes this dish special is the interplay between the creamy, tangy buttermilk sauce and the rich, smoky flavor of the roasted eggplant. The addition of pomegranate seeds provides bursts of sweet-tart flavor and jewel-like color, while the fresh herbs and za'atar contribute aromatic notes that elevate the entire preparation. The final touch of pine nuts adds a gentle crunch that contrasts beautifully with the silky eggplant flesh.

While visually impressive enough for entertaining, this dish is surprisingly straightforward to prepare and can function as either a substantial side dish or a light vegetarian main course. It embodies the philosophy that simple ingredients, when combined with thought and care, can create food that delights all the senses.

## The Art of Roasting Eggplant

The foundation of this dish is properly roasted eggplant, which requires a few key techniques:

- **Scoring the flesh**: Creating a diamond pattern allows the oil and flavorings to penetrate deeply
- **Generous oil application**: Eggplant absorbs oil readily, which helps it roast to a creamy texture
- **High heat roasting**: A hot oven caramelizes the surfaces while the interior becomes tender
- **Proper doneness**: The eggplant should be completely soft, with the flesh pulling away slightly from the skin
- **Rest before serving**: Allowing the eggplant to cool slightly helps it absorb the flavors of the sauce

The result is eggplant with a silky, almost custard-like interior and caramelized exterior that serves as the perfect canvas for the bright, tangy sauce and colorful toppings.

## Understanding Za'atar

Za'atar is a Middle Eastern spice blend that adds tremendous dimension to this dish. While you can purchase it pre-mixed, it traditionally contains:

- **Dried thyme**: Provides earthy, herbaceous notes
- **Sumac**: Contributes a lemony tang
- **Sesame seeds**: Add nutty flavor and slight crunch
- **Salt**: Enhances all the other flavors

The fresh version used in this recipe incorporates fresh thyme instead of dried for a more vibrant flavor profile. If you can find it, sumac is worth seeking out for its unique citrusy quality that can't be replicated with other ingredients.

## Serving Suggestions

This versatile dish can be incorporated into various meal contexts:

- **Mezze spread**: Serve as part of a selection of small plates with hummus, tabbouleh, and warm bread
- **Side dish**: Pair with grilled lamb, chicken, or fish
- **Vegetarian main**: Serve with couscous, quinoa, or bulgur wheat for a complete meal
- **Brunch option**: Alongside scrambled eggs for a vegetable-forward morning meal

For a complete meal with Mediterranean flair, serve with a simple cucumber and tomato salad dressed with lemon and olive oil, and warm, fluffy pita bread.

## Variations

### Smoky Eggplant with Tahini Sauce
Replace the buttermilk sauce with a mixture of tahini, lemon juice, garlic, and water for a dairy-free alternative with a nod to baba ganoush.

### Harissa-Spiced Roasted Eggplant
Add 1-2 teaspoons of harissa paste to the olive oil mixture before roasting for a spicy North African twist.

### Roasted Eggplant with Whipped Feta
Substitute the buttermilk sauce with whipped feta (8 oz feta blended with 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 tablespoon lemon juice) for a more robust flavor profile.

### Japanese-Inspired Eggplant
Brush the eggplant with a mixture of miso, mirin, and sesame oil before roasting, and top with toasted sesame seeds, sliced green onions, and a drizzle of soy sauce instead of the buttermilk sauce.
