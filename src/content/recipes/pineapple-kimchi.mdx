ingredients:
  - 1.5 pounds peeled, cored, and cubed (1-inch) ripe pineapple
  - 28 grams (3 tbsp plus 1 tsp) Diamond Crystal kosher salt
  - 17 ounces coarsely grated white onion
  - 11 ounces coarsely grated Korean radish or daikon
  - 5 tbsp gochugaru (Korean chili flakes)
instructions:
  - Put the pineapple in a large mixing bowl, sprinkle on the salt, and toss well. Let stand until the pineapple starts to give up some liquid, about 10 minutes. Add the onion, radish, and gochugaru and stir well.
  - Transfer to a clean 2-quart glass jar. Use a spoon to push down on the mixture, so the liquid rises to submerge or nearly submerge the pineapple. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing it against the surface of the mixture, then add a small weight. Cover tightly with a lid and let it ferment at room temperature until it sours slightly, 2 to 4 days, burping the container after 3 days.
  - After it's fermented to your liking, store it in the fridge for up to 6 weeks.
notes:
  - Note: The weights here are important for proper fermentation.
  - Ferment at room temperature for 2 to 4 days until it sours slightly.
  - Burp the container after 3 days to release gas buildup.
  - It's especially delicious in fried rice.
  - Stores in the fridge for up to 6 weeks.

## What Makes Pineapple Kimchi Special

While traditional kimchi is made with napa cabbage or radishes, this tropical variation uses pineapple as the base. The natural sugars in pineapple ferment beautifully, creating a unique sweet-sour-spicy condiment that maintains the essence of kimchi while offering a refreshing twist.

The sweetness of the pineapple balances the heat from the Korean chili flakes (gochugaru), while the fermentation process adds complexity and depth. As it ferments, beneficial bacteria transform the sugars, creating a tangy, probiotic-rich condiment that's both delicious and supportive of gut health.

## Understanding Fermentation

Fermentation is the process by which beneficial bacteria break down sugars in food, producing lactic acid. This:

1. **Preserves** the food naturally
2. **Enhances** the nutritional value
3. **Creates** complex flavor compounds
4. **Develops** the signature tangy taste

With pineapple kimchi, you'll know fermentation is occurring when you see small bubbles forming in the jar and notice the aroma becoming more complex and sour. The color will also deepen slightly as the fermentation progresses.

## Serving Suggestions

This versatile condiment adds a bright kick to many dishes:

- **Tacos**: Top fish or pork tacos for a fusion twist
- **Rice Bowls**: Add to bibimbap or poke bowls for acidity and heat
- **Sandwiches**: Layer on a bánh mì or grilled cheese
- **Grilled Meats**: Serve alongside grilled chicken or pork
- **Cheese Plates**: Pair with creamy cheeses for a sweet-spicy contrast
- **Avocado Toast**: Top your morning toast for a flavorful breakfast

## Variations

### Pineapple-Mango Kimchi
Add 1 cup of diced mango along with the pineapple for an even more tropical flavor profile.

### Extra Crunchy Pineapple Kimchi
Add 1 cup of julienned carrots and daikon radish to provide more texture and crunch.

### Herb-Infused Pineapple Kimchi
Add 2 tablespoons of fresh cilantro or Thai basil just before serving (not during fermentation) for a fresh herb note.
