ingredients_subsections:
  - title: Salad
    items:
      - 1 bunch kale, thick ribs cut out
      - ¼ cup dried breadcrumbs
  - title: Dressing
    items:
      - ½ garlic clove, finely chopped
      - ¼ cup finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese, plus more to finish
      - Extra-virgin olive oil
      - Juice of 1 lemon
      - ⅛ teaspoon dried chile flakes
      - Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
instructions:
  - Stack several kale leaves on top of one another and roll them up into a tight cylinder. With a sharp knife, slice crosswise into very thin, about 1/16 inch, ribbons (this is called a chiffonade).
  - Put the kale in a salad spinner, rinse in cool water, and spin until completely dry. Pile the kale into a bowl.
  - Put the chopped garlic on a cutting board and mince it even more until you have a paste (you can sort of smash and scrape the garlic with the side of the knife as well).
  - Transfer the garlic to a small bowl, add ¼ cup pecorino, a healthy glug of olive oil, the lemon juice, chile flakes, ¼ teaspoon salt, and plenty of twists of black pepper, and whisk to combine.
  - Pour the dressing over the kale and toss well to thoroughly combine (you can use your clean hands for this, to be efficient).
  - Taste and adjust with more lemon, salt, chile flakes, or black pepper. Let the salad sit for about 5 minutes so the kale softens slightly.
  - Top with the breadcrumbs, shower with more cheese, and drizzle with more oil before serving.
notes:
  - The key to this salad is massaging the dressing into the kale to break down its tough fibers.
  - Letting the dressed salad sit for 5 minutes allows the kale to soften and become more tender.
  - Lacinato kale works best for this recipe due to its tender leaves and sweet flavor.

## The Power of Raw Kale

Raw kale salads have become a modern classic, transforming what was once considered a tough, bitter green into a tender and flavorful base for countless variations. This particular preparation showcases the beauty of simplicity, using just a few high-quality ingredients to create a salad that's both nutritious and deeply satisfying.

The secret lies in the technique of massaging the dressing into the kale leaves, which breaks down the tough cellular structure and makes the greens more digestible and palatable. This method allows the robust flavors of garlic, lemon, and Pecorino Romano to penetrate the leaves, creating a harmonious blend of sharp, nutty, and bright flavors.

What makes this salad particularly appealing is its versatility and staying power. Unlike delicate lettuce-based salads that wilt quickly, dressed kale actually improves with time, making it perfect for meal prep or entertaining.

## Mastering the Technique

The success of this salad depends on several key techniques:

- **Proper kale preparation**: Removing the thick ribs and cutting the leaves into thin ribbons ensures tenderness
- **Thorough drying**: Completely dry kale prevents the dressing from becoming diluted
- **Garlic paste technique**: Mincing the garlic to a paste distributes its flavor evenly throughout the salad
- **Massage method**: Working the dressing into the kale with your hands breaks down the tough fibers
- **Resting time**: Allowing the dressed salad to sit softens the kale and melds the flavors
- **Final garnishes**: Adding breadcrumbs and extra cheese just before serving provides textural contrast

The chiffonade cut not only makes the kale more manageable to eat but also creates more surface area for the dressing to coat, ensuring every bite is well-seasoned.

## Serving Suggestions

This versatile salad can be enjoyed in many ways:

- **Standalone lunch**: Serve as a light, nutritious meal with crusty bread
- **Dinner side**: Pairs beautifully with roasted meats, grilled fish, or pasta dishes
- **Grain bowl base**: Use as the foundation for a hearty bowl topped with proteins and roasted vegetables
- **Sandwich filling**: Layer between slices of good bread with avocado and tomato
- **Potluck favorite**: Travels well and actually improves as it sits

For a more substantial meal, top with grilled chicken, roasted chickpeas, or sliced hard-boiled eggs.
