      - Honey to taste (for Werther's Original-like flavor)
      - Soy sauce to taste (for salty, deep base notes)
      - Maple syrup to taste
      - Salt to taste
      - Touch of water
      - Xanthan gum (optional, for stability)
  - title: Whipped Honey Maple Butter
    items:
      - ½ pound (2 sticks) room temperature butter
      - Similar flavorings as syrup (honey, maple, etc.)
  - title: Berry Compote
    items:
      - Equal parts blueberries and strawberries

      - Sugar (just enough to bring it up)
      - Cornstarch (for thickening)
  - title: Garnish
    items:
      - Fresh lemon zest
instructions:
  - Make Poolish (1 hour) - Combine warm water (not too hot), buttermilk, and yeast. Mix in first cup of flour until just combined. Texture should look like cottage cheese - lumps are good. Don't overmix or it will be gummy. Cover to prevent skin forming. Place in warm (not hot) spot for 1 hour. When ready, mixture should feel warm to touch and show active bubbles, with slight sour bread aroma.
  - Mix Dry Ingredients - Important salt goes in dry mix to avoid killing yeast. Combine remaining flour, sugar, salt, precisely measured baking soda and powder. Mix until homogeneous.
  - Make Maple Honey Syrup - Gently melt butter (no browning) - microwave okay. In separate bowl, combine honey, soy sauce, maple syrup, and salt. Mix until completely homogeneous - one solid color. Add to melted butter. Add touch of water. If using xanthan gum, whisk constantly while adding.
  - Make Berry Compote - Cut strawberries precisely to match blueberry size. Mix with sugar and cornstarch. Let macerate until white/powdery becomes wet/glazey. Cook quickly (1-2 minutes) - mixture will be violent and explosive initially. Done when berries become limp but maintain shape. Immediately shock in ice bath.
  - Make Final Batter - Mix wet ingredients until no yellow streaks. Combine with poolish. Gently fold in dry ingredients. Batter should look "alive" with bubbles forming and popping. Should have distinctive sourdough-like aroma.
  - Cook Pancakes - Position rack 6 inches from broiler, preheat broiler. Place pan on medium heat for full 5 minutes. Test drop should make gentle sizzle, not angry spitting. Pour ½ cup batter. Cook until bottom is golden brown. Move to cooler part for 30 seconds. Finish under broiler until top is set and lightly golden.
  - Plate for Visual Impact - Stack two golden-brown pancakes. Add vibrant berry compote. Add shaped quenelle of honey maple butter. Pour syrup generously - pancakes should be "drenched". Finish with fresh lemon zest.
notes:
  - Makes 8-10 pancakes (4-5 servings of 2 pancakes each).
  - Trust your senses when cooking - sound and smell are as important as sight.
  - The dark golden bottom won't taste burnt.
  - Cut berries exactly blueberry-sized.
  - Add more syrup than seems reasonable.

## The Perfect Weekend Breakfast

There's something magical about a stack of homemade pancakes on a lazy weekend morning. These honey butter pancakes take the classic breakfast to new heights with a simple yet transformative topping. The buttermilk in the batter creates tender, fluffy pancakes with a subtle tang that perfectly complements the sweet honey butter that slowly melts into each warm layer.

What makes these pancakes special is the balance of textures and flavors – the light, airy interior with a slightly crisp exterior, the rich butter, and the floral sweetness of honey that seeps into each bite. This recipe has been perfected through countless Sunday mornings to achieve the ideal pancake that's both simple and indulgent.

## The Art of Honey Butter

The honey butter that tops these pancakes is worth making on its own and keeping in your refrigerator for other uses. The process of whipping together softened butter and honey creates a light, airy spread that melts beautifully over warm foods.

For the **best honey butter**:
- Use high-quality honey with a flavor profile you enjoy – wildflower, clover, and orange blossom all work wonderfully
- Make sure your butter is properly softened but not melted
- Whip the mixture longer than you think necessary – about 3-4 minutes – to incorporate air for a fluffier texture
- Add a pinch of sea salt to enhance the sweet-savory contrast
- Experiment with additions like vanilla extract, orange zest, or lavender for different flavor profiles

The honey butter can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to two weeks, making it perfect for meal prep or when you want to elevate a quick breakfast.

## Variations

### Blueberry Honey Pancakes
Fold 1 cup of fresh or frozen blueberries into the batter just before cooking. The berries will burst while cooking, creating pockets of jammy sweetness throughout the pancakes.

### Whole Wheat Honey Pancakes
Replace half the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour for a nuttier flavor and added nutritional benefits. You may need to add an extra splash of buttermilk as whole wheat flour absorbs more liquid.

### Lemon Honey Pancakes
Add 1 tablespoon of lemon zest to the batter and replace the cinnamon in the honey butter with 1 teaspoon of lemon zest for a bright, citrusy variation that's perfect for spring mornings.

### Brown Butter Pancakes
For an even more indulgent flavor, brown the butter before adding it to the batter. The nutty, caramelized notes of brown butter add incredible depth to the pancakes.
