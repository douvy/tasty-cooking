title: Brined and Roasted Almonds
description: These perfectly seasoned brined and roasted almonds deliver incredible flavor and satisfying crunch. The brining process ensures the salt penetrates throughout each nut, creating a superior taste compared to regular roasted almonds. This recipe has become a favorite for its simplicity and exceptional results. You can easily scale up the quantities, but keep in mind that more nuts create more steam in the oven, requiring longer cooking times for optimal results.

ingredients:
  - 1 cup water
  - ⅓ cup kosher salt
  - 1½ cups raw skin-on almonds (8 ounces)
instructions:
  - Bring the water to a boil in a saucepan. Add the salt and stir to dissolve. Add the almonds to the hot brine, remove from the heat, and let them soak for 30 minutes.
  - Heat the oven to 375°F. Drain the almonds thoroughly and spread them evenly in a single layer on a baking sheet (use two sheets if you need to).
  - Roast until they are lightly toasted and fragrant, about 12 minutes. Take one out to test by biting into it—the interior should be a light brown, almost the color of a paper bag. The nuts will still be soft at this stage, but once completely cooled they will be very crunchy and nicely salty.
  - Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks (if you don't eat them all sooner).

## The Secret of Brining

What sets these almonds apart from standard roasted nuts is the brining process. Instead of simply salting the exterior, soaking the almonds in a salt solution allows the flavor to penetrate throughout each nut, creating a more complex and satisfying taste experience. The result is an almond that's perfectly seasoned from surface to center.

This technique was popularized by the renowned American Academy in Rome, where their chef perfected the method for serving at the Academy's daily gathering known as "aperitivo hour." The simple process transforms ordinary almonds into an extraordinary snack that's impossible to stop eating.

## Why These Almonds Work So Well

The magic of these almonds comes from several factors working together:

1. **Even Salt Distribution**: The brine ensures salt penetrates each almond instead of just sitting on the surface
2. **Textural Perfection**: The roasting process after brining creates a satisfying crunch
3. **Enhanced Nuttiness**: The gentle heat brings out the almonds' natural flavor
4. **Visual Appeal**: The golden-brown color makes them irresistible
5. **Versatility**: They work equally well as a standalone snack or recipe ingredient

## Serving Suggestions

These versatile roasted almonds can be enjoyed in numerous ways:

- **Cocktail Hour**: Serve in small bowls alongside drinks
- **Cheese Boards**: Add to charcuterie or cheese plates for textural contrast
- **Salad Topping**: Roughly chop and sprinkle over salads
- **Trail Mix**: Combine with dried fruits and dark chocolate pieces
- **Grain Bowls**: Add protein and crunch to quinoa or farro bowls
- **Yogurt Topping**: Crush slightly and sprinkle over yogurt with honey

## Variations

### Herb-Infused Almonds
Add 1 tablespoon of finely chopped fresh herbs (such as rosemary, thyme, or sage) to the almonds after roasting.

### Sweet and Spicy Almonds
Add 1 tablespoon of maple syrup and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper to the olive oil before tossing with the brined almonds.

### Garlic Parmesan Almonds
