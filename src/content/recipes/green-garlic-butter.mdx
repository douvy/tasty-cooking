title: Green Garlic Butter
description: Green garlic is the immature garlic plant before the bulb fully develops into separate cloves. It looks a lot like a thick scallion or spring onion, but the flavor is stronger and more garlicky. You could make this same style of butter with garlic scapes, scallions, or spring onions.

ingredients:
  - ½ pound unsalted butter, at room temperature
  - 1 bunch green garlic (about 6 stalks), trimmed, including ½ inch off the green tops, cut crosswise into very thin slices
  - ½ teaspoon kosher salt
instructions:
  - Melt a spoonful of the butter in a skillet, add the sliced green garlic and the salt, and cook over medium-low heat. You want to soften both the texture and the intense flavor but you don't want to brown the garlic at all; this should take around 10 minutes.
  - Let cool and then fold this into the rest of the butter using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, and pile into whatever container you want to serve or save it in.
  - Chill the butter for at least 1 hour to firm it up and to let the flavors marry and permeate the butter.
notes:
  - Green garlic is the immature garlic plant before the bulb fully develops into separate cloves.
  - You could make this same style of butter with garlic scapes, scallions, or spring onions.
  - Don't brown the garlic - you want to soften the texture and flavor, not caramelize it.

## What is Green Garlic?

Green garlic, also called spring garlic or young garlic, is immature garlic harvested before the bulbs fully develop. It resembles a large green onion or leek, with a white bulb end that transitions into green stalks. The flavor is milder and fresher than mature garlic, with subtle herbal and even slightly floral notes.

This seasonal ingredient is typically available in spring, making this compound butter a wonderful way to celebrate the season. The delicate garlic flavor infuses the butter, creating a versatile condiment that adds a burst of flavor to countless dishes.

## Culinary Uses

Green garlic butter is incredibly versatile in the kitchen:

- **Bread Enhancer**: Spread on warm crusty bread, baguettes, or dinner rolls
- **Vegetable Finisher**: Melt a pat on top of steamed or roasted vegetables
- **Protein Partner**: Place a slice on top of a hot grilled steak, chicken, or fish
- **Potato Perfection**: Stir into mashed potatoes or top a baked potato
- **Pasta Sauce Starter**: Use as the base for a quick pasta sauce with a splash of white wine
- **Corn on the Cob**: Slather on hot corn for an elevated version of this summer classic
- **Savory Oatmeal**: Stir into savory breakfast oats with a poached egg on top

## Storing and Serving

For maximum versatility, consider these storage options:

1. **Refrigerator Roll**: Shaped into a log and wrapped in parchment, the butter will keep for up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator.

2. **Freezer Portions**: For longer storage, slice the firm butter log into individual portions, wrap in parchment, and store in a freezer bag for up to 3 months.

3. **Butter Pats**: Press the soft butter into silicone ice cube trays or candy molds for perfectly portioned pats that can go straight from freezer to hot food.
