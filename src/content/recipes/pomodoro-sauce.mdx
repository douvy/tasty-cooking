  - title: Makes 6.5 cups
    items:
      - 8 lb tomatoes, such as Early Girl or San Marzano, quartered
      - ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil
      - 3 tbsp flaky sea salt
      - ½ cup basil leaves
instructions:
  - In a large stockpot over low heat, combine the tomatoes, olive oil, and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes have lost most of their acidity and the sauce begins to sweeten and thicken slightly, about 30 minutes. You want it thick enough to coat a spoon, but not too dense or pasty.
  - Add the basil and taste; if the sauce seems too acidic, adjust seasoning as needed.
  - Blend the sauce using an immersion blender until smooth, or transfer to a regular blender in batches and blend until smooth. Let cool completely.
  - Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 3 months.

## The Essence of Italian Simplicity

Pomodoro sauce, whose name literally means "tomato sauce" in Italian, embodies the philosophy that defines Italian cuisine – using few, high-quality ingredients to create something greater than the sum of its parts. Unlike more complex sauces that simmer for hours, Pomodoro is intentionally brief in its cooking time, preserving the bright, fresh flavor of tomatoes while gently mellowing their acidity.

This sauce originated in Southern Italy, particularly in Naples, where the volcanic soil produces exceptionally flavorful tomatoes. Traditional Italian cooks would make this sauce during summer when tomatoes were at their peak, capturing their essence to enjoy throughout the year. The simplicity of Pomodoro sauce makes it the perfect canvas for showcasing truly exceptional tomatoes – whether homegrown, farm-fresh, or high-quality canned San Marzanos.

What distinguishes a true Pomodoro from other tomato sauces is its light, fresh character and silky texture. It's meant to coat pasta rather than smother it, allowing the pasta itself to remain an equal partner in the dish rather than merely a vehicle for sauce. This balance is the hallmark of authentic Italian pasta preparations.

## The Technique Behind Perfect Pomodoro

Creating an exceptional Pomodoro sauce requires attention to a few key techniques:

- **Proper tomato selection**: The best sauce starts with the best tomatoes – ripe, flavorful, and preferably plum varieties like Roma or San Marzano
- **Gentle aromatic base**: Onions and garlic should be softened but not browned to maintain the sauce's bright character
- **Judicious seasoning**: Salt is added early to draw out moisture and concentrate flavors
- **Fresh herb infusion**: Adding a whole sprig of basil during cooking imparts flavor without discoloration, with fresh leaves added just before serving
- **Emulsification**: Finishing pasta directly in the sauce with a splash of pasta water creates a silky texture that clings to each strand

The relatively brief cooking time is intentional, preserving the fresh tomato flavor while allowing the aromatics to meld with the sauce. Unlike long-simmered ragùs, Pomodoro should maintain its vibrant color and distinct tomato character.

## Choosing the Right Pasta

While Pomodoro sauce pairs beautifully with almost any pasta shape, certain formats showcase it particularly well:

- **Spaghetti**: The classic choice, allowing the sauce to coat each strand evenly
- **Linguine**: Slightly wider than spaghetti, providing more surface area for the sauce
- **Bucatini**: Hollow spaghetti that captures sauce both inside and out
- **Penne**: Ridged tubes that hold pockets of sauce in their interior
- **Fusilli**: Spiral shape that traps sauce in its crevices

The key is cooking the pasta to al dente perfection and finishing it in the sauce, allowing the starch from the pasta to help the sauce adhere rather than simply pouring sauce over pasta on a plate.

## Serving Suggestions

Beyond the classic pasta preparation, Pomodoro sauce is remarkably versatile:

- **Pizza base**: Spread thinly on pizza dough before adding toppings
- **Dipping sauce**: Serve with crusty bread, mozzarella sticks, or arancini
- **Shakshuka-style**: Create wells in the simmering sauce and poach eggs directly in it
- **Eggplant or chicken Parmesan**: Use as the tomato element in these classic dishes
- **Soup starter**: Thin with vegetable or chicken broth for a quick tomato soup

For a complete Italian meal, serve Pomodoro pasta with a simple green salad dressed with olive oil and lemon, and perhaps some crusty bread to catch every last bit of sauce.

## Variations

### Vodka Pomodoro
Add 1/4 cup vodka after the garlic has cooked and let it reduce by half before adding tomatoes. Finish with 1/3 cup heavy cream for a creamy variation.

### Arrabbiata Pomodoro
Increase the red pepper flakes to 1 teaspoon for a spicier sauce that packs some heat.

### Pomodoro with Pancetta
Start by rendering 2 ounces of diced pancetta until crispy, then proceed with the recipe using the rendered fat along with olive oil for a deeper, more savory flavor profile.

### Roasted Garlic Pomodoro
Replace the sliced garlic with an entire head of roasted garlic, squeezed from its skin and mashed into the oil, for a mellower, sweeter garlic flavor throughout the sauce.
