ingredients:
  - 7 tbsp avocado oil
  - 2 small onions, cut into 1¼-inch dice
  - 4 garlic cloves, sliced
  - ½ fresh green chile, thinly sliced
  - 2 small red peppers, cut into 1¼-inch dice
  - ½ small butternut squash, peeled and cut into 1¼-inch dice
  - 1 small parsnip, peeled and cut into 1¼-inch dice
  - 1 cup French beans, trimmed
  - 1 medium zucchini, cut into 1¼-inch dice
  - ½ large eggplant, peeled and cut into 1¼-inch dice
  - 1 small potato, peeled and cut into 1¼-inch dice
  - 2 medium tomatoes, peeled and chopped
  - ½ tbsp sugar
  - 1 tbsp tomato paste
  - salt and black pepper
  - 1 cup water
  - chopped cilantro to garnish (optional)
instructions:
  - Pour two-thirds of the oil into a large heavy casserole dish or pot and place on medium-high heat. Add the onions and fry for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  - Stir in the garlic, chile and red peppers and fry for another 5 minutes. Add the squash and parsnip and continue frying for 5 minutes.
  - Using a slotted spoon, lift the vegetables out of the pot and into a medium bowl, leaving as much oil in the pot as possible. Top this up with the remaining oil.
  - Add the French beans, zucchini and eggplant to the hot oil and fry for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  - Return the contents of the bowl to the pot. Add the potato, tomatoes, sugar, tomato paste and plenty of salt and pepper. Stir well, then pour in the water, or just enough to half-cover the vegetables.
  - Cover with a lid and leave to simmer gently for 30 minutes. Taste the vegetables and add more salt and pepper, if you like.
  - Preheat the oven to 400°F. Use a slotted spoon to gently lift the vegetables from the pot and into a large, deep roasting pan to make a layer about 1¼ inches thick.
  - Pour the liquid over the vegetables and place in the oven to cook for 30 minutes. At this point all the vegetables should be very soft and most of the liquid evaporated. Garnish with cilantro, if you like, and serve.
notes:
  - Get all your prep done first - the technique is everything.
  - All vegetables should be cut into uniform 1¼-inch dice for even cooking.
  - Serves 4 as a main dish or 6-8 as a side dish.

## A Celebration of Provençal Summer

Ratatouille is the quintessential dish of Provence, a region in southern France known for its abundant sunshine, vibrant markets, and Mediterranean-influenced cuisine. This rustic vegetable stew originated as a practical way for farmers and cooks to use the bounty of summer vegetables at the height of the growing season when eggplants, zucchini, peppers, and tomatoes are at their peak of ripeness and flavor.

The charm of ratatouille lies in its simplicity and versatility. While it requires few ingredients beyond fresh vegetables, good olive oil, and herbs, it delivers remarkable depth of flavor as the vegetables slowly meld together. Each component maintains its distinct character while contributing to a harmonious whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.

Far from being merely a side dish, ratatouille embodies the Mediterranean diet's philosophy of making vegetables the star of the meal. It captures the essence of Provençal cooking: unpretentious, flavor-forward, and deeply connected to the land.

## Traditional vs. Modern Approaches

There are several approaches to making ratatouille, each with passionate adherents:

- **Traditional method (à la Provençale)**: Vegetables are cooked separately to maintain their individual integrity, then combined and slowly simmered together
- **One-pot method**: All vegetables are cooked in the same pot at different stages (as in this recipe)
- **Confit byaldi**: Made famous by the Pixar film "Ratatouille," this modern interpretation features thin slices of vegetables arranged in a spiral pattern and baked
- **Grilled variation**: Vegetables are grilled before being combined, adding a smoky dimension

This recipe follows a middle path, respecting tradition while acknowledging that most home cooks prefer the practicality of using fewer pots and pans. The key is cooking the vegetables in a sequence that respects their different cooking times and textures.

## Serving Suggestions

Ratatouille is remarkably versatile in how it can be served:

- **Traditional**: At room temperature as a starter or side dish
- **Main course**: Served hot with crusty bread and perhaps a sprinkle of cheese
- **Base for protein**: As a bed for grilled fish, chicken, or a fried egg
- **Pasta sauce**: Tossed with pasta and topped with grated Parmesan
- **Sandwich filling**: Stuffed into a baguette with goat cheese or mozzarella
- **Breakfast**: Reheated and topped with poached eggs

For wine pairings, look to Provence itself – a chilled rosé from the region makes a perfect accompaniment, as does a light-bodied red like a Côtes du Rhône.

## Seasonal Adaptations

While ratatouille is quintessentially a summer dish, the recipe can be adapted for other seasons:

- **Spring**: Include spring vegetables like asparagus and artichokes
- **Fall**: Add mushrooms and substitute butternut squash for some of the summer squash
- **Winter**: Create a heartier version with root vegetables like carrots and parsnips alongside the traditional components

## Variations

### Smoky Ratatouille
Add 1 teaspoon of smoked paprika and substitute fire-roasted canned tomatoes for fresh to create a deeper, smokier flavor profile.

### Spicy Ratatouille
Incorporate 1-2 minced jalapeños or a pinch of red pepper flakes for heat, and finish with a sprinkle of chopped cilantro instead of parsley.

### Ratatouille Tian
Slice all vegetables thinly and arrange in alternating concentric circles in a shallow baking dish. Drizzle with herb-infused olive oil and bake until tender for a beautiful presentation.

### Greek-Inspired Ratatouille
Add 1/2 cup of Kalamata olives, 2 tablespoons of capers, and finish with crumbled feta cheese for a Mediterranean twist that bridges French and Greek cuisines.
