ingredients:
  - 2 cups raw whole cashews (about 9 ounces)

  - ¾ teaspoon garlic powder
  - ½ teaspoon onion powder

  - Combine all spices and 1 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Gradually sprinkle over cashews, tossing continuously until every nut is coated.
  - Spread in a single layer on the baking sheet. Roast for 14 minutes, stirring once at 7 minutes. Done when matte, deeply aromatic, and slightly darkened. They'll still feel soft.

  - Stir at the 7-minute mark to ensure even roasting and prevent burning.
  - Adjust cayenne to taste for more or less heat.

## The Art of Spiced Nuts

This barbecue spice blend draws inspiration from classic American barbecue seasonings, combining the smokiness of paprika with the warmth of cumin and the subtle heat of cayenne. The butter helps the spices adhere while contributing richness that balances the bold flavors.

The key to perfect spiced cashews is patience. While they may feel soft straight from the oven, resist the temptation to continue roasting. The nuts crisp beautifully as they cool, and over-roasting will result in a bitter taste.

## Why This Spice Blend Works

The combination of spices creates layers of flavor:

- **Smoked Paprika**: Provides the signature smoky backbone
- **Garlic & Onion Powder**: Add savory depth
- **Cumin**: Brings earthy warmth
- **Dry Mustard**: Contributes subtle tanginess
- **Cayenne**: Delivers gentle heat that builds
- **Brown Sugar**: Balances the spices with subtle sweetness
- **Flaky Sea Salt**: Enhances all flavors and adds texture

## Serving Suggestions

These versatile spiced cashews are perfect for:

- **Happy Hour**: Serve alongside cocktails or cold beer
- **Game Day**: A crowd-pleasing snack for gatherings
- **Cheese Boards**: Add to charcuterie plates for contrast
- **Gift Giving**: Package in mason jars for homemade gifts
- **Trail Mix**: Combine with dried fruit and dark chocolate

## Variations

### Extra Smoky
Double the smoked paprika and add ¼ teaspoon liquid smoke to the melted butter.

### Sweet Heat
Increase brown sugar to 1 tablespoon and cayenne to ¾ teaspoon.

### Ranch Style
Replace cumin with dried dill and add ½ teaspoon dried chives.
