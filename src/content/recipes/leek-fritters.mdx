  - title: Fritters
    items:
      - 3 leeks (1 lb in total, trimmed weight)
      - 5 shallots, finely chopped
      - ⅔ cup olive oil
      - 1 fresh red chile, seeded and sliced
      - ½ cup parsley (leaves and fine stalks), finely chopped
      - ¾ tsp ground coriander
      - 1 tsp ground cumin
      - ¼ tsp ground turmeric
      - ¼ tsp ground cinnamon
      - 1 tsp sugar
      - ½ tsp salt
      - 1 egg white
      - ¾ cup plus 1 tbsp self-rising flour
      - 1 tbsp baking powder
      - 1 egg
      - ⅔ cup milk
      - 4½ tbsp unsalted butter, melted
instructions:
  - To make the sauce, blitz all sauce ingredients together in a food processor until uniform green. Set aside.
  - Cut the leeks into scant 1-inch-thick slices; rinse and drain dry. Sauté the leeks and shallots in a pan with half the oil on medium heat for about 15 minutes, or until soft.
  - Transfer to a large bowl and add the chile, parsley, spices, sugar and salt. Allow to cool down.
  - Whisk the egg white to soft peaks and fold it into the vegetables.
  - In another bowl mix together the flour, baking powder, whole egg, milk and butter to form a batter. Gently mix it into the egg white and vegetable mixture.
  - Put 2 tablespoons of the remaining oil in a large frying pan and place over medium heat. Spoon about half of the vegetable mixture into the pan to make four large fritters.
  - Fry them for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until golden and crisp. Remove to paper towels and keep warm. Continue making the fritters, adding more oil as needed. You should end up with about eight large fritters.
  - Serve warm, with the sauce on the side or drizzled over.
notes:
  - You should end up with about eight large fritters total.
  - Serve warm with the herb yogurt sauce on the side or drizzled over.
  - The aromatic spices give these a Turkish-inspired flavor profile.

## The Delicate Charm of Leeks

Leeks, often overlooked in favor of their more assertive cousin the onion, take center stage in these delightful fritters. With their mild, sweet flavor and silky texture when cooked, leeks transform into something magical when combined with herbs and fried to crispy perfection.

These fritters draw inspiration from various Mediterranean cuisines, particularly from the eastern Mediterranean regions where vegetable fritters are a beloved part of mezze spreads. Similar to Greek kolokithokeftedes (zucchini fritters) or Turkish mücver, these leek fritters balance the vegetable's natural sweetness with herbs and a touch of spice, creating a complex yet comforting flavor profile.

What makes these fritters special is their versatility – they can be served as an elegant appetizer with drinks, a light lunch with a side salad, or even as a creative side dish to a larger meal. The accompanying yogurt sauce adds a tangy counterpoint that cuts through the richness of the fried fritters.

## The Art of the Perfect Fritter

Creating the ideal vegetable fritter is a balancing act between texture and flavor. Here are the key techniques to master:

- **Proper vegetable preparation**: Blanching the leeks briefly softens them while preserving their color and flavor
- **Moisture control**: The critical step of removing excess moisture prevents soggy fritters and dangerous oil splatters
- **Minimal binder**: Using just enough egg and flour to hold the fritters together, but not so much that they become doughy
- **Proper frying temperature**: Medium heat allows the fritters to cook through while developing a golden crust
- **Consistent size**: Keeping the fritters relatively small (about 2-3 inches) ensures they cook evenly and remain crisp
- **Proper draining**: Removing excess oil on paper towels keeps the fritters crisp rather than greasy

The technique of blanching the leeks before incorporating them into the batter serves multiple purposes – it removes some of the raw allium bite, softens them slightly, and helps set their vibrant color.

## Serving Suggestions

These versatile fritters can be enjoyed in many ways:

- **Classic appetizer**: Serve with the yogurt sauce and lemon wedges as part of a mezze spread
- **Brunch star**: Top with a poached egg and a sprinkle of za'atar
- **Light lunch**: Pair with a simple green salad dressed with lemon vinaigrette
- **Dinner accompaniment**: Serve alongside grilled fish or roasted chicken
- **Sandwich component**: Place between slices of good bread with tomatoes and greens for a vegetarian sandwich

For an impressive Mediterranean spread, serve these fritters alongside hummus, olives, roasted red peppers, and warm pita bread.

## Variations

### Leek and Potato Fritters
Add 1 cup of grated potato (squeezed dry) to the mixture for a more substantial fritter with a classic flavor combination.

### Herbed Leek and Feta Fritters
Increase the herbs to 1/4 cup each of dill and parsley, and add 1/2 cup of crumbled feta cheese for a Greek-inspired variation.

### Spiced Leek Fritters with Harissa Yogurt
Add 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of allspice to the batter, and mix 1-2 teaspoons of harissa paste into the yogurt sauce for a North African twist.

### Spring Onion Fritters
Replace half the leeks with thinly sliced spring onions or scallions for a more assertive allium flavor that works beautifully with the fresh herbs.
