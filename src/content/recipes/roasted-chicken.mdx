      - ½ tbsp minced fresh thyme leaves
      - 1 sprig thyme
      - 3 medium garlic cloves, minced
      - 2 medium garlic cloves, peeled
      - ½ tsp fine sea salt

      - 2 tbsp (30 ml) red wine vinegar
      - ¼ tsp fine sea salt
      - ¼ tsp freshly ground black pepper
      - ¼ cup (60 ml) extra-virgin olive oil
instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 375°F with a rack in the center. Remove giblets and pat chicken dry with paper towels. Set the chicken on a rack in a large roasting pan, breast side up.
  - Combine rosemary, thyme, garlic, salt, pepper, and olive oil in a mortar, and smash it all into a paste with the pestle.
  - Rub the paste all over the chicken skin.
  - Stuff chicken with sliced lemon, rosemary sprig, thyme sprig, and whole garlic.
  - Roast the chicken for 20 minutes with the breast side up. Then flip it and cook 20 minutes more, breast side down. Turn it over again and cook for an additional 40 minutes, breast side up. Remove the chicken from the oven when the juices run clear and a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 165° F.
  - While the chicken roasts, make the dressing. Whisk together the shallot, vinegar, salt, and pepper and let sit for a few minutes. Then whisk in the olive oil in a slow stream to emulsify.

## The Art of Roasting a Chicken

There's something deeply satisfying about mastering the classic roasted chicken. This seemingly simple dish is often considered the true test of a cook's skill – get it right, and you have a masterpiece of contrasting textures and rich flavors. The exterior should be golden and crisp while the interior remains juicy and tender, perfumed with herbs and aromatics.

The beauty of a roasted chicken lies in its versatility and timelessness. It's equally at home at a casual family dinner as it is at an elegant gathering. And while the technique is straightforward, the little details make all the difference – from properly drying the skin to allowing the cooked bird to rest before carving.

This recipe focuses on classic flavors with fresh herbs and garlic, but once you've mastered the basic method, you can experiment with countless variations to suit your taste and the seasons.

## Keys to Perfect Roasted Chicken

Achieving that restaurant-quality roasted chicken at home comes down to a few essential techniques:

- **Temperature management**: Starting with a high heat creates a beautiful golden exterior, while finishing at a moderate temperature ensures the chicken cooks through without burning
- **Butter and herbs**: The combination of butter and olive oil allows for both flavor and a higher smoke point
- **Under the skin**: Placing seasoned butter directly under the skin infuses the meat with flavor while helping to crisp the skin
- **Proper resting**: Allowing the chicken to rest after cooking is crucial – it lets the juices redistribute throughout the meat instead of running out when carved
- **Internal temperature**: Using a meat thermometer eliminates guesswork and ensures food safety without overcooking

The aromatics placed inside the cavity – lemon and onion in this recipe – steam during cooking, infusing the meat from the inside with subtle flavor and moisture.

## Serving Suggestions

A perfect roasted chicken deserves perfect accompaniments:

- **Classic sides**: Mashed potatoes, roasted root vegetables, or a simple green salad
- **Bread**: Crusty bread to soak up the flavorful juices
- **Sauces**: While excellent on its own, a simple pan gravy or herb sauce can elevate the dish
- **Wine pairing**: A medium-bodied white wine like Chardonnay or a light red like Pinot Noir complements the flavors beautifully

For a complete Sunday dinner, serve with Yorkshire puddings and roasted Brussels sprouts.

## Variations

### Herb and Citrus Chicken
Use a mixture of citrus fruits (orange, lemon, lime) inside the cavity and add their zest to the butter mixture for a bright, fresh variation.

### Garlic and Rosemary Chicken
Increase the garlic to 6-8 cloves and use mostly rosemary for the herbs. Add whole garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs to the roasting pan for an aromatic roast.

### Spice-Rubbed Chicken
Replace the herbs with a spice mixture like paprika, cumin, coriander, and a touch of cinnamon for a warming, exotic flavor profile.

### Beer Can Chicken
For a different approach altogether, try the famous "beer can chicken" method where the bird is roasted in an upright position over a partially full can of beer, keeping the meat incredibly moist.
