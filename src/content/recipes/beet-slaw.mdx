ingredients:
  - 2 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled
  - ½ cup golden raisins
  - 2 tbsp white wine vinegar
  - 1¼ lbs beets, peeled
  - 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
  - ½ cup lightly packed flat-leaf parsley leaves
  - ¼ cup lightly packed mint leaves
  - ½ tsp dried chile flakes
  - Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
  - Extra-virgin olive oil
  - Pistachio Butter
instructions:
  - Combine the garlic, raisins, and vinegar in a large bowl and let sit for 1 hour.
  - Cut the beets into fine julienne. Your hands will get stained, but the color fades quickly.
  - Remove the garlic from the raisins and discard. Add the beets, lemon juice, most of the parsley and mint (save the rest for finishing), and chile flakes.
  - Season with 1½ tsp salt and lots of black pepper and toss. Let sit for about 5 minutes, then taste. The slaw should be tart, spicy, peppery, and sweet. Adjust seasoning if necessary, then add ¼ cup olive oil. Toss and taste again.
  - To serve, spread a layer of pistachio butter onto each plate and top with the slaw. Finish with the reserved fresh herbs and a drizzle of olive oil.
notes:
  - Let the raisin and vinegar mixture sit for the full hour to develop flavor.
  - The natural juices from the beets will create a delicious vinaigrette as the slaw sits.
  - Your hands will get stained from the beets, but the color fades quickly.

## The Beauty of Raw Beets

While roasted beets are widely appreciated for their sweet, earthy flavor, raw beets offer a completely different experience. When shredded, raw beets provide a crisp texture and fresh flavor that's less intensely earthy than their cooked counterparts. In this slaw, the natural sweetness of raw beets is balanced by the tartness of apple and the bright acidity of citrus.

Beyond their culinary appeal, raw beets retain more of their nutritional benefits, including folate, manganese, and nitrates that support cardiovascular health. The vivid color comes from betalains, powerful antioxidants that give beets their signature magenta hue and offer anti-inflammatory benefits.

## Ingredient Harmony

This slaw creates a perfect balance of flavors and textures:

- **Beets**: Provide earthy sweetness and stunning color
- **Apple**: Adds crisp texture and tart-sweet flavor
- **Carrot**: Offers subtle sweetness and complementary color
- **Red Onion**: Contributes sharp, aromatic notes
- **Citrus**: Brightens the entire dish with acidic counterpoints
- **Cumin**: Adds a warm, earthy depth that enhances the beets
- **Herbs**: Bring fresh, vibrant notes that lift the flavor profile

## Serving Suggestions

This versatile slaw can be enjoyed in numerous ways:

- **Side Dish**: Serve alongside grilled proteins or hearty main courses
- **Sandwich Layer**: Add to sandwiches or wraps for color and crunch
- **Salad Base**: Top with grilled chicken or salmon for a complete meal
- **Taco Topping**: Use instead of traditional cabbage slaw on fish tacos
- **Grain Bowl Addition**: Mix into quinoa or farro bowls for texture and flavor
- **Appetizer**: Serve on endive leaves or cucumber rounds as a vibrant finger food

## Variations

### Mediterranean Beet Slaw
Add 1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese, 2 tablespoons chopped Kalamata olives, and substitute the cumin with 1 teaspoon dried oregano.

### Asian-Inspired Beet Slaw
Replace the orange juice with lime juice, add 1 teaspoon grated ginger, and substitute the cumin with 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil.

### Golden Beet Variation
Use golden beets instead of red for a more delicate flavor and striking yellow color. Add 1/4 cup dried cranberries for color contrast.
