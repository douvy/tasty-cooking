            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Tomato confit is a preservation method where tomatoes are slow-roasted at a low temperature while submerged in olive oil with herbs and spices. Unlike regular roasted tomatoes (which are typically cooked at higher temperatures for shorter periods), confit tomatoes cook very slowly, allowing them to develop a deeply concentrated flavor while remaining somewhat tender rather than fully dehydrated. The preservation in oil gives them a silky texture and extends their shelf life significantly. Both the tomatoes and the infused oil are usable in cooking."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Yes, you can use different varieties of tomatoes, though some work better than others. Roma (plum) tomatoes are ideal because they have fewer seeds and more flesh, making them perfect for confit. Cherry or grape tomatoes can be used whole (no need to peel) for a different presentation. Heirloom varieties add interesting flavors but may contain more seeds and water. Regardless of variety, choose ripe but firm tomatoes for the best results. If using larger varieties like beefsteak, you'll need to cut them into smaller pieces and be particularly thorough about removing seeds to prevent excess moisture."

Try these uses: 1) Toss with pasta or gnocchi for an instant sauce; 2) Spread on crostini or bruschetta; 3) Add to sandwiches or wraps; 4) Fold into scrambled eggs or omelets; 5) Mix into risotto; 6) Use as a pizza topping; 7) Blend into vinaigrettes or sauces; 8) Serve alongside grilled meats or fish; 9) Add to grain bowls or salads; 10) Use the infused oil for dipping bread, drizzling over finished dishes, or as the base for salad dressings. The confit adds concentrated tomato flavor to virtually any savory dish."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Traditional water bath or pressure canning is not recommended for tomato confit due to the low acid and high oil content, which can create an environment for botulism if not properly processed. For longer storage, freezing is the safest option. Portion the cooled confit into ice cube trays or small containers, leaving some headspace for expansion, and freeze for up to 6 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before use. Alternatively, you can make smaller batches more frequently and enjoy them fresh. Always ensure the tomatoes remain fully submerged in oil while refrigerated and use clean utensils when removing portions to prevent contamination."

Try these variations: 1) Add rosemary sprigs for a more robust herbal flavor; 2) Include lemon zest for brightness; 3) Add bay leaves for depth; 4) Use smoked paprika instead of red pepper flakes for a smoky quality; 5) Try fresh oregano instead of dried; 6) Add fennel seeds for an anise note; 7) Include a cinnamon stick for warmth; 8) Try star anise for exotic complexity; 9) Add whole black peppercorns; or 10) Include thin slices of fresh chili peppers for more heat. Just remember that the flavors will concentrate during the long cooking process."

                    These preserved tomatoes are versatile and can be used year-round. When fresh tomatoes are out of season, canned San Marzano tomatoes add depth and complexity. Use the tomato oil on any dish that benefits from a touch of olive oil and tomato flavor—which is a lot!

            <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 text-off-white leading-8">
                <li class="mb-2">Preheat the oven to 250°F. Bring a large pot of water to boil over high heat. Prepare an ice-water bath by filling a large bowl with ice water.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Use a paring knife to score a small X in the bottom of each tomato. Plunge the tomatoes into the boiling water for 20 seconds, and immediately transfer them to the ice-water bath. Work in batches, if necessary, until all the tomatoes have been blanched.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">When the tomatoes are cool, remove them from the water. With a sharp paring knife, peel the skin from the tomatoes; it should slip off easily. Cut the tomatoes into halves or quarters, depending on size, and gently pull the seeds out with your fingers. The tomatoes do not need to be perfectly seedless, but do your best to clean them so just the tomato flesh remains.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Place the tomatoes in a shallow baking dish or roasting pan and season with salt. Scatter the garlic, thyme, oregano, red pepper flakes, and basil leaves over the tomatoes. Pour the olive oil over all. Bake until the tomatoes are shriveled and browned around the edges, 3 to 4 hours. Turn them and move them around occasionally while baking so that the tomatoes closest to the edge of the pan don’t burn. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 month, completely covered with olive oil to prevent air from reaching them.</li>
