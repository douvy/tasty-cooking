Since frozen green beans are already blanched before freezing, you should skip the blanching step in the recipe. Simply thaw the frozen beans completely (either overnight in the refrigerator or using the quick-thaw method in a colander under cool running water), then pat them very dry with paper towels before tossing with the dressing. For the best results with frozen beans, look for 'whole' or 'French cut' varieties rather than pre-cut pieces, as they tend to maintain better texture after thawing."

Double-check that your tamari is specifically labeled gluten-free, as some varieties may contain trace amounts of wheat. Alternatively, you could use coconut aminos as a completely gluten-free soy sauce alternative, though it is slightly sweeter so you might want to reduce or omit the agave/maple syrup. All other ingredients in the recipe (green beans, sesame seeds, tahini, agave/maple syrup, and salt) are naturally gluten-free."

For Asian-inspired meals, serve them alongside teriyaki salmon, miso-glazed cod, Korean bulgogi, Chinese stir-fried tofu, or Japanese chicken katsu. The nutty sesame flavor also complements simple proteins like roasted chicken, grilled steak, or baked tempeh. For complete meals, add these green beans to grain bowls with brown rice or quinoa, topped with a protein of your choice. The dish is versatile enough to work with both casual weeknight dinners and more elegant dinner parties, adding color, nutrition, and flavor to the plate."

Store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week. The tahini-based dressing acts as a preservative and keeps the beans tasting fresh. For the best flavor and texture when serving leftovers, remove them from the refrigerator about 15-20 minutes before eating to take the chill off. While microwaving is not recommended (as it can make the beans soggy), you can briefly heat them in a skillet over low heat if you prefer them warm. These green beans also make excellent additions to lunch boxes or cold grain salads throughout the week."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Blanching the green beans serves several important purposes in this recipe: 1) It quickly cooks the beans to a perfect crisp-tender texture while maintaining their vibrant green color. 2) The brief cooking time (just 90 seconds) ensures the beans won't be raw but also won't become mushy. 3) The ice bath immediately stops the cooking process, preventing overcooking and preserving the beans' texture and color. 4) Blanching helps to clean the surface of the beans and removes any surface enzymes that might cause deterioration during storage. If you prefer completely raw green beans, you can skip the blanching step, but the flavor and texture will be significantly different - much crunchier and with a more pronounced raw bean taste."

Try adding: 1) Thinly sliced red bell peppers or carrots for color and sweetness (no need to blanch these). 2) Blanched snow peas or sugar snap peas for a complementary texture. 3) Toasted sliced almonds or chopped peanuts for additional crunch. 4) A sprinkle of red pepper flakes or a drizzle of chili oil for heat. 5) Thinly sliced green onions or chives as a fresh garnish. 6) A tablespoon of minced fresh ginger or garlic for aromatic depth (add these to the dressing). 7) Edamame beans for added protein. For a more substantial salad, you could even toss the dressed green beans with cold soba noodles for a delicious noodle salad."
